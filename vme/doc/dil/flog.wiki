= flog =
 function: integer '''flog'''(filename : string, s : string, wa : string);

The '''flog''' function allows you to split up your logs in the log directory so that you don't end up with everything in the main vme.log.

== Description ==
The flog function allows you to split up your logs in the log directory so that you don't end up with everything in the main vme.log.

The append/write argument must be in lower case and can only be a 'w' or a 'a' surrounded by quotes. If the argument is a 'w' it will overwrite any log file by that name. If the argument is an 'a' it will append to the file by that name.

'''Note:''' This function requires zone access level > 1 to use.

   flog(self.zonidx+".log", s, "a");
} dilend

t := z.symname + " ["+self.name+"] " + asctime(realtime)+ argument;
t := textformat(t);
i := flog("bugs", t, "a");

// Create a fresh daily log
flog("daily.log", "Daily log started: " + asctime(realtime), "w");
