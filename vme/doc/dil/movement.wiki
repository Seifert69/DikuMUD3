= movement =

== Syntax ==
 field: '''.movement''' (Read/Write)

== Description ==
The '''movement''' field specifies the terrain type or sector of a room, which determines movement costs, swimming requirements, and other environmental effects. This field is used to control how characters and NPCs move through different types of terrain.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| Read || integer || Returns the current terrain type as a SECT_* constant
|-
| Write || integer || Sets the terrain type using SECT_* constants
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes ==
The movement field uses SECT_* constants defined in values.h and/or vme.h. Common terrain types include:
* '''SECT_WATER_SAIL''' - Water terrain requiring swimming or boats
* '''SECT_INSIDE''' - Indoor areas
* '''SECT_CITY''' - City streets
* '''SECT_FIELD''' - Open fields
* '''SECT_FOREST''' - Forested areas
* '''SECT_MOUNTAIN''' - Mountainous terrain
* '''SECT_DESERT''' - Desert areas

The terrain type affects:
* Movement endurance costs via the [[Manual:DIL_Manual/movementloss|movementloss]] function
* Swimming requirements and drowning checks
* Special movement behaviors for different races

== Examples ==
 dilbegin terrain_check();
 var
    current_room : unitptr;
    terrain_type : integer;
 code
 {
    current_room := unit_room@function(self);
    terrain_type := current_room.movement;
    
    if (terrain_type == SECT_WATER_SAIL)
    {
       exec("say This area requires swimming or a boat!", self);
    }
    else if (terrain_type == SECT_INSIDE)
    {
       exec("say We are indoors.", self);
    }
    
    // Change terrain to forest
    current_room.movement := SECT_FOREST;
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
* Accessing .movement on non-room units will result in a DIL runtime error
* Setting invalid terrain values may cause undefined behavior
* The field requires a valid room unit pointer
