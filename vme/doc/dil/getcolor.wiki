= getcolor =
 function: string '''getcolor'''({color_string : string});

The '''getcolor''' function processes color strings by calling the internal divcolor() function.

== Description ==
The '''getcolor''' function processes color strings by calling the internal divcolor() function. This function appears to convert or divide color codes within the input string.

Note: This function is different from the player-specific color functions (addcolor, delcolor, changecolor) which work with individual player color settings. The getcolor() function works with color code processing and conversion.

The function is currently marked as unused in the codebase, suggesting it may be obsolete or awaiting testing and implementation.
