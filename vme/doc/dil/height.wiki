= height =

 field: integer '''height''' (Read/Write)

== Description ==
The height of a PC/NPC, the length of a rope, or the size of weapons, armours, and shields. This is a read-write field of a unitptr.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.height || integer || The height/size of the unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_height_fit(pc : unitptr, armor : unitptr);
 var
     height_diff : integer;
     percent_diff : integer;
 code
 {
     if (armor.type != UNIT_ST_OBJ)
     {
         exec("say This is not an object.", self);
         quit;
     }
     
     height_diff := pc.height - armor.height;
     percent_diff := (height_diff * 100) / pc.height;
     
     if (percent_diff < -10)
     {
         exec("say This armor is much too large for you.", self);
     }
     else if (percent_diff > 10)
     {
         exec("say This armor is much too small for you.", self);
     }
     else
     {
         exec("say This armor should fit you reasonably well.", self);
     }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is read-write (RW)
* For PCs and NPCs: represents character height
* For objects like ropes: represents length
* For weapons, armor, and shields: represents size
* Commonly used in resizing calculations and equipment fitting checks
* Height values are typically in centimeters or similar units

== Error Handling ==
* Setting height to 0 or negative values may cause unexpected behavior
* When modifying height, consider the impact on gameplay balance
* Always validate height ranges are appropriate for the unit type
