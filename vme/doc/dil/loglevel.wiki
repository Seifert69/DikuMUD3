field: integer '''.loglevel''' (Read-only)

== Description ==
The '''.loglevel''' field is accessed on a '''cmdptr''' (command pointer) and returns an integer value representing the minimum character level that can see log entries for this command. A value of 0 indicates that no logging is performed for this command.

This field is useful for understanding which commands have logging enabled and at what privilege level the logs are accessible.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Field !! Type !! Access !! Description
|-
| .loglevel || integer || Read-only || Minimum character level that can see command logs (0 = no logging)
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit type:
* cmdptr (Command pointer)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin log_example(arg : string);
 var
   cmd : cmdptr;
   log_level : integer;

 code
 {
   // Get a specific command
   cmd := getcommand("kick");
   
   if (cmd)
   {
     log_level := cmd.loglevel;
     
     if (log_level = 0)
       act("Command '$2t' has no logging enabled.", A_ALWAYS, self, cmd.name, null, TO_CHAR);
     else
       act("Command '$2t' logs are visible to level $3d+ characters.", A_ALWAYS, self, cmd.name, log_level, TO_CHAR);
   }
   else
     act("Command 'kick' not found.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);

   quit;
 }
 dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''.loglevel''' field is read-only and cannot be modified
* A value of 0 means the command does not generate any log entries
* Higher values indicate that only characters at or above that level can view the command's logs
* This field is typically used by administrators and builders to understand command logging behavior

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a null '''cmdptr''', the operation will return '''fail'''
* If accessed on an invalid pointer type, the operation will result in an error
