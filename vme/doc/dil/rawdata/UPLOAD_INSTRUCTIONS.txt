MediaWiki XML Import Instructions
==================================

You now have a file called 'dil_manual_import.xml' that contains all your .wiki files
in MediaWiki's XML import format. Here are several ways to upload it:

METHOD 1: Using MediaWiki's importDump.php (Recommended)
-------------------------------------------------------
If you have server access to your MediaWiki installation:

1. Upload the XML file to your MediaWiki server (e.g., via scp/ftp)
2. SSH into your server
3. Navigate to your MediaWiki directory
4. Run: php maintenance/importDump.php dil_manual_import.xml
5. Run: php maintenance/rebuildrecentchanges.php (to update recent changes)

METHOD 2: Using Special:Import in the wiki interface
----------------------------------------------------
1. Log in as an admin user on your wiki
2. Go to Special:Import (https://wiki.dikumud.net/wiki/Special:Import)
3. Upload the XML file through the web interface
4. Note: This may require admin privileges and file upload permissions

METHOD 3: Enable API editing
---------------------------
If you want to use the original API uploader, you may need to edit LocalSettings.php:

1. Add or uncomment these lines:
   $wgEnableAPI = true;
   $wgEnableWriteAPI = true;
   
2. Ensure your user has API editing permissions:
   $wgGroupPermissions['user']['writeapi'] = true;
   $wgGroupPermissions['bot']['writeapi'] = true;

3. Restart your web server

METHOD 4: Manual page creation
------------------------------
As a last resort, you can create pages manually:
1. For each .wiki file, go to: https://wiki.dikumud.net/wiki/Manual:DIL_Manual/filename
2. Click "Create" or "Edit"
3. Copy and paste the content from the .wiki file (after removing line numbers)

FILE FORMAT NOTES
-----------------
- Line numbers (like "00001| ") have been automatically removed
- Pages are created under "Manual:DIL_Manual/" namespace
- All content is properly escaped for XML
- Each page includes attribution and timestamps

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Try Method 1 first if you have server access
2. If not, try Method 2 through the web interface
3. For future uploads, consider enabling API editing (Method 3)
