 'excmdstr_case'
    This variable is a string which contains the "first string" which was entered
    by a player. The result of adding:

       excmdstr_case + " " + argument

    is the entire string as entered by the player.
    The 'excmdstr' is not changed in anyway from how a player types it.
    If a player types 'S' then the 'excmdstr_case' will have 'S' in it.
