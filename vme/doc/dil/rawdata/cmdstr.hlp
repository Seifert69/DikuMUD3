 'cmdstr'
    This variable is a string which contains the "command" which was entered
    by a player. The result of adding:

       cmdstr + " " + argument

    is the entire string as entered by the player.
    The 'cmdstr' is EXPANDED by the interpreter, so assume a player
    types 's' then the string is expanded to 'south'.
