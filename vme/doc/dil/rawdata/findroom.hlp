unitptr findroom ( s : string )
    s : Symbolic name of room.
    return: A pointer to the room, or null
    Example: findroom("inn@udgaard")

Will return the unitptr to the room. If the symbolic name is not a room then NULL will
be returned.  Using findsymbolic(#) is equally efficient and does the same except it
returns any type. This function is really mostly here for historical reasons.
