 'heartbeat'
    This is the DIL programs heartbeat. It can be assigned runtime to
    change the rate with which SFB_TICK is activated. Do not set it
    too low, and remember that it is specified in 1/4th of a second.
    use the constant PULSE_SEC to multiply your wanted delay, for
    Example:
       heartbeat := PULSE_SEC*25; /* Tick every 25 seconds */
