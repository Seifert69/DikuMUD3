= opendiff =
 field: integer '''.opendiff''' (Read/Write)

The '''opendiff''' field provides access to the open difficulty modifier for units.

== Description ==
The '''opendiff''' field represents how difficult it is to open or pick the lock on a unit, affecting the success rate of lockpicking attempts and other opening actions. Based on the C implementation, this field returns a reference to the unit's open difficulty value, allowing both reading and writing of the modifier.

== Field Access ==
This is a field access on unitptrs:
 unit.opendiff

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes ==
This field represents the difficulty level for opening or picking locks on the unit.
Higher values make locks more difficult to pick, while lower values make them easier.
This field is used in conjunction with [[Manual:DIL_Manual/openflags|openflags]] to determine the lock state.
The value is typically used as a modifier in skill checks for lockpicking abilities.

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_lock_difficulty(target : unitptr);
 var
    difficulty : integer;
 
 code
 {
    if (target == null)
    {
       act("No target specified.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       return;
    }
    
    difficulty := target.opendiff;
    
    if (difficulty == 0)
       act("$1n has no lock difficulty.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    else if (difficulty < 10)
       act("$1n has an easy lock (difficulty: $2d).", A_ALWAYS, self, difficulty, target, TO_CHAR);
    else if (difficulty < 20)
       act("$1n has a moderate lock (difficulty: $2d).", A_ALWAYS, self, difficulty, target, TO_CHAR);
    else if (difficulty < 30)
       act("$1n has a hard lock (difficulty: $2d).", A_ALWAYS, self, difficulty, target, TO_CHAR);
    else
       act("$1n has an extremely hard lock (difficulty: $2d).", A_ALWAYS, self, difficulty, target, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
Always verify the unit pointer is valid before accessing opendiff:

 if (unit != null)
 {
    difficulty := unit.opendiff;
 }
 else
 {
    act("Invalid unit pointer.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
