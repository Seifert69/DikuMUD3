= fits =
 function: string '''fits'''(char : unitptr, obj : unitptr, pos : integer);

The '''fits''' function tests if an object can be worn by a character in a specific position.

== Description ==
This function tests if "obj" can be worn by "char" in position "pos". If pos is -1, then fits automatically figures out the default worn position for "obj".

The function is useful for checking whether an armor or clothing item will fit a character before attempting to equip it or sell it to them.

== PARAMETERS ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| char || unitptr || Character which we want to test if obj can be fitted upon
|-
| obj || unitptr || The object we want to see if fits char
|-
| pos || integer || -1 or WEAR_XXX position where object would be worn
|}

== Examples ==
s := fits(self, obj, -1);
if (s != "")
  exec("say Don't buy it, its "+s, self);

// Check if helmet fits
result := fits(player, helmet, WEAR_HEAD);
if (result == "")
{
   // Helmet fits, can proceed
}
else
{
   // Helmet doesn't fit, explain why
   exec("say This helmet won't fit you: " + result, self);
}

== Usage Notes ==
* Returns empty string ("") if the object fits the character
* Returns textual description of why it doesn't fit (e.g., "too small", "too large")
* Use -1 for pos to let the function determine the default position
* Useful for shopkeepers and equipment validation

== Error Handling ==
* Returns error description if object doesn't fit
* Invalid WEAR_* positions may cause unexpected behavior
* Always check the returned string for fit status
