= exec =
 function: void '''exec'''(command_string : string, target_unit : unitptr);

The exec function forces a unit to execute a command as if they had typed it at the command prompt.

== Description ==
The '''exec''' function forces a unit (PC or NPC) to execute a command as if they had typed it at the command prompt. The command is processed through the normal command interpreter, giving the same results and feedback as if the player had entered it manually.

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| command_string || string || Command and arguments to perform
|-
| target_unit || unitptr || Unit to perform command
|}

== Examples ==
 dilbegin force_movement(pc : unitptr);
 code
 {
    exec("north", pc);
    exec("say I'm moving!", pc);
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* Commands longer than MAX_INPUT_LENGTH are truncated and logged
* Immortal-level commands cannot be executed on immortal characters
* The function tracks nested exec() calls for security purposes
* If the target unit is secured using secure(), the exec() call will test for secure violations

== Error Handling ==
* It is not directly possible to detect whether the command was successful or failed
* The target unit receives normal feedback messages for the command
* If the command fails, the target is notified normally
