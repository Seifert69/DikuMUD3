/* 
  You can define up to PROFESSION_MAX different professions.

  If you need more you have to increase PROFESSION_MAX in values.h,
  add the #define PROFESSION_ and recompile.

  Please note the professions need to be sequential. If there's a gap
  in the sequence, e.g. if you omit profession 5 but have 6 and 7, then
  you'll mess stuff up.
