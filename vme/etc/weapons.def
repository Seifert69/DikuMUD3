  Reworked by MS 2020. Cleaned up. Adding char abilities to weapons.

  Reworked by Darg april 2001.


  See spells.def for most details. The damage tables determine the amount
  of damage given by each weapon. The following table shows how ALPHA
  (the third value) basically determines number of hits required before
  an opponent of equal status is killed (RTK is rounds to kill).
  However, the weapon skill can not be practiced above 100%, but this is
  compensated for by doing predictive calculations.

HM Increase per level is 5.00

Formula for damage:

    A number list like this {50,30,5}, where the first number is the
    minimum amount required to roll to give damage. The second number
    is the base damage when successful, and the third is what the excess
    is divided by before it is added to the damage.

        if (roll >= num1)
           damage = num2 + (roll - num1)/num3

     'roll' is the total of dice rolls, resistances, bonuses, skills, etc.
