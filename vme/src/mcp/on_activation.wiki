= on_activation =
 function: integer '''on_activation'''(dilexp : string, label : string);

Sets up an interrupt that is executed before every activation of DIL program, allowing conditional control over program execution based on game state.

== Description ==
The '''on_activation''' function creates a special type of interrupt that evaluates a boolean expression each time the DIL program is about to be activated. This is particularly useful for catching situations where an NPC has fallen asleep, is fighting, is injured, or is in other states that should prevent normal program execution.

When the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE:
* If the label parameter is '''SKIP''', the program activation is skipped for this cycle but the interrupt remains active
* If the label parameter is a valid label name, the program jumps to that label and the interrupt is automatically cleared

When the boolean expression evaluates to FALSE, the program continues normal execution and the interrupt remains active for future activations.

The function returns an integer index that can be used with the '''clear()''' function to manually remove the interrupt.

Internally, '''on_activation''' is implemented as a macro that calls '''interrupt'''(SFB_ACTIVATE, dilexp, label).

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| dilexp || string || A boolean DIL expression to evaluate before each program activation
|-
| label || string || Label to jump to if expression is true, or the reserved keyword '''SKIP'''
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer representing the index to the interrupt handling the on_activation. This value can be used with the '''clear()''' function to manually remove the interrupt.

== Examples ==
 dilbegin guard_post();
 var
 code
 {
    on_activation((self.position <= POSITION_SLEEPING) or 
                 (self.position == POSITION_FIGHTING), skip);
    
    :start:
    heartbeat := PULSE_SEC*5;
    pause;
    exec("say I am on duty and alert.", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''on_activation''' interrupt is evaluated before every program activation, before any other interrupts
* When using '''SKIP''', the program simply doesn't activate for that cycle but the interrupt remains active
* When jumping to a label, the interrupt is automatically cleared after the jump
* The interrupt remains active until explicitly cleared with '''clear()''' or when triggered with a label jump
* Multiple '''on_activation''' calls can be made to handle different conditions
* The boolean expression can be complex, using logical operators (and, or) and parentheses
* The expression should be efficient as it's evaluated frequently
* Common use cases include checking position states, health conditions, combat status, or environmental factors
* The expression is evaluated in the context of the program owner (self)

== Error Handling ==
* If the boolean expression contains invalid syntax, the program will fail to compile
* If the specified label doesn't exist, a runtime error will occur when the condition evaluates to true
* Invalid return values from '''clear()''' are ignored silently
* The interrupt index returned should be stored if you plan to manually clear the interrupt
* Ensure proper parentheses usage in complex boolean expressions to avoid evaluation order issues
