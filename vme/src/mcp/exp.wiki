= exp =

== Description ==
The '''exp''' field is a read-only integer field available on both player characters (PC) and non-player characters (NPC). For PCs, it represents the total number of experience points the character has accumulated. For NPCs, it represents the experience quality or value of the monster.

== Availability ==
This field is available when the unit type is:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)

== Usage ==
The exp field is read-only and cannot be directly assigned. To modify experience values, use the [[experience()]] function.

=== Syntax ===
  unit.exp

=== Return Value ===
Returns an integer representing:
* For PCs: Total experience points accumulated
* For NPCs: Experience quality/value of the monster

== Example ==
 dilbegin check_exp(u:unitptr);
 var
    current_exp:integer;
 code
 {
    heartbeat:=3;
    if (u.type!=UNIT_ST_PC and u.type!=UNIT_ST_NPC)
       return;

    current_exp := u.exp;
    sendtext("Current experience: " + itoa(current_exp) + "<br/>", self);
    return;
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* The field is read-only - use the experience() function to modify values
* For PCs, this value affects leveling when compared against the exptol field
* For NPCs, this value typically determines the experience reward when killed
* The experience() function should be used with care, preferably with integer constants

* [[experience()]] - Function to modify experience values
* [[exptol]] - Experience needed for next level (PC only)
* [[level]] - Current level of the unit
