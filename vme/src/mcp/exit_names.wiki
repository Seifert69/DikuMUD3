= exit_names =
 field: stringlist '''.exit_names'''[direction] (Read/Write)

The exit_names field provides access to the name list for room exits.

== Description ==
The '''exit_names''' field provides access to the list of names associated with a room exit. These names are what players type to use the exit (e.g., "door", "gate", "north", "open grate"). The field returns a reference to the actual name list, allowing both reading and writing.

Each exit can have multiple names, allowing for multiple ways to reference the same exit.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| room.exit_names[direction] || stringlist || The list of names for the specified exit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin show_exit_name(room : unitptr, dir : integer);
 var
    names : stringlist;
 code
 {
    names := room.exit_names[dir];
    if (length(names) > 0)
       act("The exit is called: $2t", A_ALWAYS, self, names.[0], null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

 dilbegin dynamic_exit_names(room : unitptr);
 code
 {
    if (isset(room.exit_info[NORTH], EX_CLOSED))
       room.exit_names[NORTH] := {"closed door", "barrier"};
    else
       room.exit_names[NORTH] := {"open door", "entrance"};
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the directional constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* The first name ([0]) is typically used for display purposes
* Players can use any name in the list to reference the exit
* Modifying exit names affects how players interact with the exit immediately

== Error Handling ==
* Returns empty stringlist if the exit doesn't exist
* Returns fail if accessed on non-room units
