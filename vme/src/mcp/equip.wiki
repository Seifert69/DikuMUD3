** Combat calculations based on gear
** Special effect processing

== Example ==
 dilbegin fnpri(FN_PRI_RESCUE-1) aware unique cuffed(depname : string);
 var
    cuffs  : unitptr;
    deputy : unitptr;
 code
 {
    cuffs := equipment(self, WEAR_WRIST_R);
    secure(cuffs, broken);
    
    deputy := self.master;
    secure(deputy, broken);
    
    if ((deputy == null) or (cuffs == null))
    {
       log("Cuffed lost either deputy or cuffs");
       goto broken;
    }
    
    heartbeat := PULSE_SEC * 1;
    
 :loop:
    if (cuffs.equip != WEAR_WRIST_R)
       goto broken;
    priority;
    wait(SFB_TICK|SFB_CMD, activator == self);
    goto loop;
    
 :broken:
    i := dildestroy("cuffed2@midgaard", self);
    quit;
 } dilend
