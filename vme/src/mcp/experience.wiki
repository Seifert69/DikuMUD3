|-
| target || unitptr || The player character to receive the experience change

 code
 {
    if (pc.type == UNIT_ST_PC)
    {

    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This function only works on player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* Use with extreme care as it directly affects player progression
* It is recommended to use integer constants for the amount parameter to avoid errors
* The function logs experience gains to the system log
* Negative values will subtract experience from the player

== Error Handling ==
* The function will silently fail if called on non-player units
* Always validate that the target is a player character before calling
