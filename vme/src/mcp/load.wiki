= load =

function: unitptr '''load'''(s : string);

== Description ==

The '''load''' function creates a new unit from the database using its symbolic name. The loaded unit is automatically placed inside the unit that executed the load command.

== PARAMETERS ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| s || string || Symbolic name of the unit to load (format: "name@zone")
|}

== Examples ==

The load function performs the following operations:

* Looks up the unit in the database using the symbolic name
* Creates a new instance of the unit (except for rooms, which cannot be loaded)
* If the unit is money, properly initializes the money amount
* Automatically places the loaded unit inside the loading unit's inventory
* Activates any load-time DIL programs on the loaded unit

 dilbegin example_load();
 var
    obj : unitptr;
 
 code
 {
    obj := load("tbag@midgaard");
    if (obj != null)
    {
       link(obj, self);
       exec("say I loaded a trash bag!", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Failed to load the bag.", self);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==

* Rooms cannot be loaded and will generate an error in the system log
* If the symbolic name does not exist, an error is logged and null is returned
* The loaded unit is automatically placed in the loader's inventory
* Use the [[link]] procedure to move the loaded unit to a different location
* Money units are properly initialized with their correct amount
* Symbolic names follow the format "name@zone" (e.g., "garlic@midgaard")

== Error Handling ==

* Returns '''null''' if the symbolic name does not exist
* Returns '''null''' if attempting to load a room
* Logs errors to the system log for debugging
