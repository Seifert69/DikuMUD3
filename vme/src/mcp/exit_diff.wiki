= exit_diff =
 field: integer '''.exit_diff'''[direction] (Read-only)

The exit_diff field returns the skill difficulty value for a specific exit in a room.

== Description ==
The '''exit_diff''' field returns the skill difficulty value for a specific exit in a room. This difficulty value is used in skill checks to determine whether a character can successfully traverse the exit, particularly for exits that require special skills like climbing.

The difficulty is an integer that represents how challenging it is to use the exit. Higher values indicate greater difficulty.

| room.exit_diff[direction] || integer || The difficulty level of the specified exit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_climb_difficulty(room : unitptr, dir : integer);
 var
    difficulty : integer;
 code
 {
    if (room.exit_info[dir] & EX_CLIMB)
    {
       difficulty := room.exit_diff[dir];
       if (skillcheck(SKI_CLIMB, ABIL_DEX, difficulty) > 0)
          act("You successfully climb.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       else
          act("You fail to climb.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the predefined direction constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* This field is read-only - difficulty values are typically set through the building/editor system
* Common difficulty values range from 0 (easy) to 100+ (very difficult)

== Error Handling ==
* Returns DILV_FAIL if the exit doesn't exist or the parameters are invalid
