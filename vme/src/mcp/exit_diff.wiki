= exit_diff =

== Syntax ==
 room.exit_diff[direction] : integer (Read-Only)

== Parameters ==
 room : A unit of type UNIT_ST_ROOM
 direction : Exit direction index (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)

== Description ==
The exit_diff field returns the skill difficulty value for a specific exit in a room. This difficulty value is used in skill checks to determine whether a character can successfully traverse the exit, particularly for exits that require special skills like climbing.

The difficulty is an integer that represents how challenging it is to use the exit. Higher values indicate greater difficulty. This value is typically used in conjunction with skill check functions to determine success or failure.

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer representing the difficulty level of the specified exit. Returns DILV_FAIL if the exit doesn't exist or the parameters are invalid.

== Examples ==
=== Basic Usage ===
 difficulty := room.exit_diff[NORTH];
 
=== Skill Check Example ===
 // Check if character can climb an exit
 if (room.exit_info[dir] & EX_CLIMB)
 {
    difficulty := room.exit_diff[dir];
    success := skillcheck(SKI_CLIMB, ABIL_DEX, difficulty);
    if (success > 0)
    {
       act("You successfully climb the $2t.", A_ALWAYS, self, exit_name, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else
    {
       act("You fail to climb the $2t.", A_ALWAYS, self, exit_name, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 }

=== Complete Example from DIL ===
 // From climb_dil example
 room_going := room.exit_to[dir];
 difficulty := room.exit_diff[dir];

 if (self.drunk > 0)
 {
    difficulty := difficulty + 5 * self.drunk;
    act("Climbing under influence isn't easy.", A_SOMEONE, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }

 hm := skillchecksa@skills(SKI_CLIMB, ABIL_DEX, difficulty);

== Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the predefined direction constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* This field is read-only - difficulty values are typically set through the building/editor system
* The difficulty value is used by skill check functions to determine success probability
* Common difficulty values might range from 0 (easy) to 100+ (very difficult)
* Some exits may have a difficulty of 0 if they don't require special skills
