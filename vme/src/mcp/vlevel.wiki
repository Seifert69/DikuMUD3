= vlevel =
 field: integer '''.vlevel''' (Read-only or Read/Write)
 
The '''vlevel''' field provides access to a player's virtual level, which represents their effective level for game mechanics and access control.

== Description ==
The '''vlevel''' field returns the virtual level of a player character. This virtual level may differ from the character's actual [[#upc|level]] and is used for various game mechanics including access control, skill calculations, and content restrictions. The field's access permissions depend on the zone's access level - in high-access zones it's read-only, while in normal zones it may be read-write.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| pc.vlevel || integer || Returns the virtual level of the player character
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Examples ==
=== Basic Level Check ===
 dilbegin check_virtual_level();
 var
   player : unitptr;
 
 code
 {
   player := activator;
   if (player.vlevel >= 50)
   {
     sendtext("You have sufficient virtual level for this area.<br/>", player);
   }
   else
   {
     sendtext("You need virtual level 50 to enter this area.<br/>", player);
   }
 } dilend

=== Virtual Level Comparison ===
 dilbegin compare_levels();
 var
   pc1 : unitptr;
   pc2 : unitptr;
 
 code
 {
   pc1 := self;
   pc2 := activator;
   
   if (pc1.vlevel > pc2.vlevel)
   {
     sendtext("Your virtual level is higher than " + pc2.name + ".<br/>", pc1);
   }
   else if (pc1.vlevel < pc2.vlevel)
   {
     sendtext(pc2.name + " has a higher virtual level than you.<br/>", pc1);
   }
   else
   {
     sendtext("You and " + pc2.name + " have the same virtual level.<br/>", pc1);
   }
 } dilend

=== Level-Based Reward ===
 dilbegin virtual_level_reward();
 var
   player : unitptr;
   bonus : integer;
 
 code
 {
   player := activator;
   bonus := player.vlevel / 10; // Bonus based on virtual level
   
   if (bonus > 0)
   {
     sendtext("You receive a bonus of " + itoa(bonus) + " gold coins!<br/>", player);
     // Add actual gold reward here
   }
   else
   {
     sendtext("Your virtual level is too low for a bonus.<br/>", player);
   }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''vlevel''' field is only available on player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* Access permissions vary by zone access level:
** High-access zones: Read-only access
** Normal zones: May have read-write access
* Virtual level is used for:
** Access control to restricted areas
** Skill and ability calculations
** Combat and damage calculations
** Quest and content eligibility
* Virtual level can be modified independently of the character's actual level
* The field is commonly used in clan systems, guild systems, and area restrictions
* Virtual level is saved with the player character

== Error Handling ==
* Accessing '''vlevel''' on a non-player unit will result in FAIL
* Accessing '''vlevel''' on a null unit pointer will result in FAIL
* Write access may be restricted based on zone access permissions
* The field gracefully handles edge cases and invalid units
