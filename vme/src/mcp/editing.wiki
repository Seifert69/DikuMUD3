 field: integer '''.editing''' (Read-only)

'''editing''' is a field accessor that checks if a player character is currently in text editing mode.

== Description ==
The editing field indicates whether a player character is currently in text editing mode. This typically occurs when players are writing messages, notes, board posts, or other text content using the game's built-in editor.

The editing mode is activated by:
* Using the '''beginedit''' function
* Writing on message boards
* Creating notes or letters
* Other text input scenarios

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"

| unitptr.editing || integer || TRUE (1) if editing, FALSE (0) if not editing (Read-only)
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Usage Notes ==
* The value is automatically managed by the game system
* The field is commonly used to:
** Prevent multiple simultaneous editing sessions
** Handle interruptions during editing
** Manage board and note systems
** Control text input flows

== Example ==
 dilbegin aware do_write (arg:string);
 var
    u:unitptr;
 code
 {
    if (self.type!=UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;

    // Check if player is already editing
    if (self.editing)
    {
       act("You are already editing something.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       quit;
    }

    // Start editing session
    beginedit(self);
    wait(SFB_EDIT, self==activator);
    
    // Player is now done editing
    act("Done editing", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
