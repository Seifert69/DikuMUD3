'''editing''' is a field accessor that checks if a player character is currently in text editing mode.

== Syntax ==
 integer := unitptr.editing

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer:
* TRUE (1) if the player is currently editing text
* FALSE (0) if the player is not editing text

== Description ==
The editing field indicates whether a player character is currently in text editing mode. This typically occurs when players are writing messages, notes, board posts, or other text content using the game's built-in editor.

The editing mode is activated by:
* Using the '''beginedit''' function
* Writing on message boards
* Creating notes or letters
* Other text input scenarios

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is read-only for most DIL programs
* The value is automatically managed by the game system
* The field is commonly used to:
** Prevent multiple simultaneous editing sessions
** Handle interruptions during editing
** Manage board and note systems
** Control text input flows

== Example ==
 dilbegin aware do_write (arg:string);
 var
    u:unitptr;
 code
 {
    if (self.type!=UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;

    // Check if player is already editing
    if (self.editing)
    {
       act("You are already editing something.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       quit;
    }

    // Start editing session
    beginedit(self);
    wait(SFB_EDIT, self==activator);
    
    // Player is now done editing
    act("Done editing", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend
