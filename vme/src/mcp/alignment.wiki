 dilbegin example();
 var
  i : integer;
 code

  i := alignment(self);
  if (i > 500)
  {
    sendtext("You are very good!<br/>", self);
  }
  else if (i < -500)
  {
    sendtext("You are very evil!<br/>", self);
  }
  else
  {
    sendtext("You are neutral.<br/>", self);
  }
 } dilend

 dilbegin alignment_check();
 var
  target : unitptr;
 code
 {
  :start:
  target := findunit(self, argument, FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);
  if (target.type == UNIT_ST_PC)
  {
    if (alignment(target) < 0)
    {
      sendtext(target.name + " is evil!<br/>", self);
