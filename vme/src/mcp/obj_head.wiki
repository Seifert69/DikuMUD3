= obj_head =
 function: unitptr '''obj_head'''();

The '''obj_head'''() function returns a pointer to the first object in the global object list.

== Description ==
The '''obj_head'''() function provides access to the head of the linked list containing all objects currently loaded in the game. Based on the C implementation, the function checks if the global object head pointer (`g_obj_head`) points to a valid object using the `isObj()` method. If valid, it returns the pointer; otherwise, it returns null.

== Return Value ==
Returns unitptr:
* '''unitptr''' - Pointer to the first object in the global object list
* '''null''' - If no objects are loaded or the head pointer is invalid

== Usage Notes ==
* This function is currently marked as obsolete and not used in any DIL programs
* The returned pointer can be used to traverse the global object list
* Always check for null before using the returned pointer
* This function provides access to all objects in the game, regardless of location

== Examples ==
 dilbegin list_objects();
 var
    current_obj : unitptr;
    count : integer;
 
 code
 {
    count := 0;
    current_obj := obj_head();
    
    while (current_obj != null)
    {
       count := count + 1;
       act("Object: $1n", A_ALWAYS, self, current_obj, null, TO_CHAR);
       current_obj := current_obj.next;
    }
    
    act("Total objects: $2d", A_ALWAYS, self, count, null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
Always check the return value for null before using it:

 first_obj := obj_head();
 if (first_obj != null)
 {
    name := first_obj.name;
 }
 else
 {
    act("No objects found.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
