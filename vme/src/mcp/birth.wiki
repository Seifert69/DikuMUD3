= birth =

== Description ==
Returns the birth time of a player character. This represents when the character was created in the game.

== Syntax ==
 birth(unit)

== Parameters ==
; unit : unitptr
: The player character whose birth time is being retrieved

== Return Value ==
: integer
: The Unix timestamp when the character was created

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_age();
 var
  birth_time : integer;
  age_days : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  birth_time := birth(self);
  age_days := (realtime - birth_time) / (60 * 60 * 24);
  sendtext("You are " + itoa(age_days) + " days old.<br/>", self);
 } dilend

 dilbegin character_info();
 var
  creation_time : integer;
  creation_date : string;
 code
 {
  :start:
  creation_time := birth(activator);
  creation_date := asctime(creation_time);
  sendtext("Character created: " + creation_date + "<br/>", activator);
 } dilend

 dilbegin birthday_check();
 var
  char_birth : integer;
  current_time : integer;
  years_old : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  char_birth := birth(self);
  current_time := realtime;
  years_old := (current_time - char_birth) / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
  sendtext("You are " + itoa(years_old) + " years old.<br/>", self);
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This is a read-only property that returns character creation time
* The value is a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
* Commonly used with asctime() to convert to readable format
* Used for age calculations, character history, and account management
* Birth time is set when a character is first created and never changes
* The timestamp can be used for various time-based calculations

* realtime - For getting current time
* age calculations - For determining character age from birth time
