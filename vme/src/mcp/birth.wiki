= birth =
 function: integer '''birth'''(unit : unitptr);

The '''birth''' function returns the birth time of a player character.

== Description ==
Returns the birth time of a player character. This represents when the character was created in the game.

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit || unitptr || The player character whose birth time is being retrieved
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer:
* '''integer''' - The Unix timestamp when the character was created
* '''fail''' - If unit parameter is invalid or not a player

== Examples ==
=== Character Age ===
 dilbegin check_age();
 var
    birth_time : integer;
    age_days : integer;
 code
 {
    birth_time := birth(self);
    age_days := (realtime - birth_time) / (60 * 60 * 24);
    send("You are " + itoa(age_days) + " days old.");
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Character Information ===
 dilbegin character_info();
 var
    creation_time : integer;
    creation_date : string;
 code
 {
    creation_time := birth(activator);
    creation_date := asctime(creation_time);
    send("Character created: " + creation_date);
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Birthday Check ===
 dilbegin birthday_check();
 var
    char_birth : integer;
    current_time : integer;
    years_old : integer;
 code
 {
    char_birth := birth(self);
    current_time := realtime;
    years_old := (current_time - char_birth) / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
    send("You are " + itoa(years_old) + " years old.");
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Account Age Verification ===
 dilbegin verify_account_age(minimum_days : integer);
 var
    player_birth : integer;
    account_age : integer;
 code
 {
    player_birth := birth(activator);
    account_age := (realtime - player_birth) / (60 * 60 * 24);
    
    if (account_age >= minimum_days) {
       send("Account is old enough: " + itoa(account_age) + " days.");
    } else {
       send("Account is too young: " + itoa(account_age) + " days (minimum: " + itoa(minimum_days) + ")");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Veteran Status ===
 dilbegin check_veteran_status();
 var
    char_birth : integer;
    days_old : integer;
 code
 {
    char_birth := birth(self);
    days_old := (realtime - char_birth) / (60 * 60 * 24);
    
    if (days_old >= 365) {
       send("You are a veteran player (" + itoa(days_old) + " days old)!");
    } else if (days_old >= 30) {
       send("You are an experienced player (" + itoa(days_old) + " days old).");
    } else {
       send("You are a new player (" + itoa(days_old) + " days old).");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This is a read-only property that returns the character creation time
* The value is a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
* Commonly used with asctime() to convert to readable format
* Used for age calculations, character history, and account management
* Birth time is set when a character is first created and never changes
* The timestamp can be used for various time-based calculations
* Only works on player characters (UNIT_ST_PC), not NPCs

== Error Handling ==
The function performs validation:
* '''Unit validation''' - Ensures unit is a valid unit pointer
* '''Type validation''' - Returns fail if unit is not a player character
* '''Range validation''' - Validates timestamp is within reasonable bounds

== Related Functions ==

* [[realtime]] - For getting the current time
* [[age calculations]] - For determining character age from birth time
