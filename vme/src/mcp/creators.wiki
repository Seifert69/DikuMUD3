== Syntax ==
 zone.creators : stringlist (read-only)

== Description ==
The creators field is a read-only property of zone units that returns a stringlist containing the names of creators who contributed to that zone. This provides information about the authors or builders responsible for the zone's content and design.

The creators list typically contains the names of the original zone creators, contributors, or maintainers who worked on developing the zone's areas, rooms, mobiles, and objects.

== Usage Notes ==
* Only available on zone units (UNIT_ST_ROOM with zone properties)
* Returns a stringlist containing creator names
* The field is read-only and cannot be modified through DIL
* Useful for help systems, zone information displays, and credit attribution
* Often used in help commands to show who created specific areas

== Examples ==
=== Basic creator display ===
 dilbegin show_creators();
 var
    zone : unitptr;
    creator_list : stringlist;
    i : integer;
 code
 {
    zone := self.outside;
    
    if (zone and zone.creators)
    {
        act("Zone creators:", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        
        for (i := 0; i < length(zone.creators); i := i + 1)
        {
            act("  " + zone.creators.[i], A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        }
    }
    else
        act("No creator information available for this zone.", 
                A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Zone information command ===
 dilbegin zone_info();
 var
    current_zone : unitptr;
    creator_count : integer;
 code
 {
    current_zone := self.outside;
    
    while (current_zone.type != UNIT_ST_ROOM)
        current_zone := current_zone.outside;
    
    if (current_zone)
    {
        act("Zone: " + current_zone.zoneidx, A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        act("Name: " + current_zone.title, A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        
        if (current_zone.creators)
        {
            creator_count := length(current_zone.creators);
            act("Creators (" + itoa(creator_count) + "):", 
                    A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
            
            // Display each creator
            pagestring(current_zone.creators, self);
        }
        else
            act("No creator information available.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Help system integration ===
 dilbegin help_creators();
 var
    zone : unitptr;
    help_text : string;
 code
 {
    zone := self.outside;
    
    while (zone.type != UNIT_ST_ROOM)
        zone := zone.outside;
    
    if (zone and zone.creators)
    {
        help_text := "This area was created by: ";
        
        // Format creator list nicely
        if (length(zone.creators) == 1)
            help_text := help_text + zone.creators.[0];
        else
        {
            help_text := help_text + zone.creators.[0];
            
            for (i := 1; i < length(zone.creators); i := i + 1)
            {
                if (i == length(zone.creators) - 1)
                    help_text := help_text + " and " + zone.creators.[i];
                else
                    help_text := help_text + ", " + zone.creators.[i];
            }
        }
        
        sendtext(help_text, self);
    }
    else
        sendtext("No creator information available for this area.", self);
    
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Multi-zone creator search ===
 dilbegin find_zone_creators(zone_name : string);
 var
    zone_ptr : zoneptr;
    found_creators : stringlist;
 code
 {
    zone_ptr := zhead();
    
    while (zone_ptr)
    {
        if (zone_ptr.name == zone_name)
        {
            found_creators := zone_ptr.creators;
            break;
        }
        zone_ptr := zone_ptr.next;
    }
    
    if (found_creators)
    {
        act("Creators of zone '" + zone_name + "':", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        pagestring(found_creators, self);
    }
    else
        act("Zone '" + zone_name + "' not found or has no creator information.", 
                A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    
    quit;
 } dilend

== Implementation Details ==
The creators field is implemented as a reference to the zone's creator list (getCreators()). This returns a stringlist containing the names of all individuals credited with creating or contributing to the zone. The field is read-only to prevent unauthorized modification of creator attribution. The information is typically stored in the zone data and loaded when the zone is initialized.
