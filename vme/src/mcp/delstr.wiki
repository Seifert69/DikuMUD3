= delstr =

'''delstr''' is a DIL function that deletes string files from the game's file system.

== Syntax ==
 integer delstr( filename : string ) ;

== Parameters ==
; filename
: The name of the string file to be deleted

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer:
* TRUE (1) if the file was successfully deleted
* FALSE (0) if the file was not deleted

== Description ==
The delstr function is used to delete files that are managed by the string file system (used with '''loadstr''' and '''savestr''' functions). The function operates with the following security restrictions:

* Only deletes files within the zone's designated string file directory
* Requires zone access level 10 or lower
* Validates filenames to prevent directory traversal attacks
* Files are located in the zone's "strings/" subdirectory

== Security Considerations ==
* Zones with access level greater than 10 cannot use this function
* Filenames are validated for security - attempts to use illegal filenames will be logged and return FALSE
* The function only operates within the zone's designated string file directory

== Usage Notes ==
* This function is typically used for managing temporary files, board messages, or other string-based data storage
* The file deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
* Use the return value to verify whether the deletion was successful

== Example ==
 dilbegin news_del(arg : string);
 var
         ret:integer;/*to hold the return value if deleted or not*/
 code
 {
 ret:= delstr("news.txt");
 if (!ret)
         {
         log ("File not deleted.");
         quit;
         }

 sendtext ("News file deleted\n",self);
 quit;/*dil delete routine done
 }
 dilend
