= access =
 function: integer '''access'''(unitptr : unitptr, zone : zoneptr);

The '''access''' function is a built-in DIL (DikuMUD Interactive Language) function that checks if a player has a specific access level for a given zone.

== Description ==
This function checks if a player has sufficient access level for a specified zone. It compares the player's level against the zone's access requirements and returns the access level.

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| unitptr || unitptr || The player unit to check access for
|-
| zone || zoneptr || The zone to check access level for
|}

== Access Levels ==
Access levels are typically defined as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! Level !! Description !! Typical Use
|-
| 0 || No access || Basic player access
|-
| 1 || Limited access || Restricted areas
|-
| 2 || Builder access || Zone building tools
|-
| 3 || Administrator access || Full system access
|-
| 4+ || Root/Immortal access || Complete control
|}

== Examples ==
=== Basic Access Check ===
 dilbegin check_zone_access(player : unitptr, zone_name : string);
 var
    target_zone : zoneptr;
    access_level : integer;
 code
 {
    target_zone := findsymbolic(zone_name);
    if (target_zone == null) {
       send("Zone '" + zone_name + "' not found.");
       quit;
    }
    
    access_level := access(player, target_zone);
    
    if (access_level > 0) {
       send("You have access to zone '" + zone_name + "' (level " + itoa(access_level) + ").");
    } else {
       send("You do not have access to zone '" + zone_name + "'.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Administrative Access Check ===
 dilbegin admin_area_check(player : unitptr);
 var
    admin_zone : zoneptr;
 code
 {
    admin_zone := findsymbolic("admin_zone");
    if (admin_zone == null) {
       send("Admin zone not found.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (access(player, admin_zone) >= 3) {
       send("You have administrative access.");
    } else {
       send("You lack administrative access.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
The function performs validation:
* '''Zone validation'' - Ensures zone parameter is valid and not null
* '''Type validation'' - Returns fail if zone is not a valid zoneptr
* '''Access level retrieval'' - Safely gets the zone's access level

Note: The C implementation shows that this function:
* Uses getAccessLevel() method to retrieve the zone's access level
* Compares the player's level against the zone's access requirement
* Returns TRUE (1) if player level >= zone access level, FALSE (0) otherwise
* The function is commonly used for zone security and access control

== Usage Notes ==
* This function is used for zone-based access control
* Access levels are typically defined in zone configuration files
* The function only checks access - it does not grant or modify access
* Use with zoneptr functions to navigate through zones
* Commonly used in zone entry points, command restrictions, and area security
* The function works with player units (PCs), not NPCs or other unit types
* Access levels are cumulative - higher levels include all lower level permissions
* Zone access is separate from character level or other security measures
