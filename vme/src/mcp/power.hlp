<span id="power"></span>
 'power'
    This variable is an integer which can be reassigned. It is used in
    permission messages and in a few done messages. For example a permission
    request to damage a person with 100 damage would have power equal 100.
    This could then be reduced to 50 by assigning a new number.
    See description of messages for more information.
