= exit_info =
 field: integer '''.exit_info'''[direction] (Read/Write)

The exit_info field provides access to the flag bits for room exits.

== Description ==
The '''exit_info''' field provides access to the condition flags that control how an exit behaves. These flags determine whether an exit is closed, locked, hidden, etc. The field returns a reference to the actual exit flags, allowing both reading and writing.

Common exit flags include:
; EX_CLOSED : The exit is closed and cannot be passed
; EX_LOCKED : The exit is locked and requires a key
; EX_HIDDEN : The exit is hidden from players
; EX_PICKPROOF : The exit cannot be picked
; EX_NOPASS : The exit cannot be passed even when open
; EX_NOFLEE : Players cannot flee through this exit
; EX_CLIMB : The exit requires climbing
; EX_WIZARD : Only wizards can use this exit

| room.exit_info[direction] || integer || The flag bits for the specified exit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin toggle_door(room : unitptr);
 code
 {
    if (isset(room.exit_info[NORTH], EX_CLOSED))
    {
       unset(room.exit_info[NORTH], EX_CLOSED);
       act("The door swings open.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_ALL);
    }
    else
    {
       set(room.exit_info[NORTH], EX_CLOSED);
       act("The door swings shut.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_ALL);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the directional constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* The exit must exist for the specified direction, otherwise the operation will fail
* Modifying exit flags affects the actual game world immediately

== Error Handling ==
* Returns fail if accessed on non-room units
* Operation fails if the direction index is out of range
