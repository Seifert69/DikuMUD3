= roomflags =
 field: integer '''.roomflags''' (Read/Write)

The .roomflags field contains bit flags that specify various properties and behaviors of a room unit.

== Description ==
The .roomflags field is an integer bitfield that controls various properties and behaviors of room units. Each bit in the field represents a specific room characteristic or restriction. The field uses the ROOM_FL_* constants defined in values.h and/or vme.h to set and check individual flags.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| Read || integer || Returns the current room flags as a bitfield
|-
| Write || integer || Sets the room flags to the specified bitfield value
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
=== Checking Room Flags ===
 dilbegin check_room_dark();
 var
     my_room : unitptr;
 code
 {
     my_room := self.outside;
     
     if (isset(my_room.roomflags, ROOM_FL_DARK))
         sendtext("This room is dark.&n", self);
     else
         sendtext("This room is well lit.&n", self);
 }
 dilend

=== Setting Room Flags ===
 dilbegin make_room_private();
 var
     my_room : unitptr;
 code
 {
     my_room := self.outside;
     
     // Make the room private (no teleportation)
     my_room.roomflags := my_room.roomflags | ROOM_FL_PRIVATE;
     
     sendtext("The room is now private.&n", self);
 }
 dilend

=== Clearing Room Flags ===
 dilbegin remove_no_magic();
 var
     my_room : unitptr;
 code
 {
     my_room := self.outside;
     
     // Remove the no-magic restriction
     my_room.roomflags := my_room.roomflags & ~ROOM_FL_NO_MAGIC;
     
     sendtext("Magic can now be used in this room.&n", self);
 }
 dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* Use the '''isset()''' function to check if specific flags are set
* Use bitwise operators (|, &, ~) to modify individual flags
* The field uses ROOM_FL_* constants from values.h and/or vme.h
* Changes to room flags affect all characters in the room immediately
* Some room flags may have game-wide implications (e.g., ROOM_FL_PRIVATE, ROOM_FL_NO_MAGIC)

== Error Handling ==
* Accessing .roomflags on non-room units will result in DILV_FAIL
* Invalid flag values may cause unexpected room behavior
* Always validate flag combinations before setting them
