= findsymbolic =

== Syntax ==
There are three forms of the findsymbolic function:

 unitptr findsymbolic( s : string )
 unitptr findsymbolic( s : string, idx : integer )
 unitptr findsymbolic( u : unitptr, s : string, i : integer )

== Parameters ==
=== Single Parameter Form ===
; s : string
: Symbolic name of the unit to find (player, room, object, NPC) in the format "name@zone"

=== Two Parameter Form ===
; s : string
: Symbolic name of the unit to find (player, room, object, NPC) in the format "name@zone"
; idx : integer
: The index to match for finding a precise unique unit, see unitptr.idx

=== Three Parameter Form ===
; u : unitptr
: Search is relative to this unit.
; s : string
: Symbolic name of the NPC or Object to find in the format "name@zone"
; i : integer
: FIND_UNIT_XXX bit vector of places to search.

== Return Value ==
Returns a pointer to an instance of the unit, or null if not found.

== Description ==
This routine supplements findunit() and findroom(). It comes in handy if it is important to get a unitptr to a unit in the world. This is super fast and a great routine if it doesn't matter where in the world the unit is.

=== Single Parameter Form ===
This form finds any unit (player, room, object, NPC) by its symbolic name. If there are multiple instances of the same symbolic name, it will return a random one of them.

=== Two Parameter Form ===
This form helps you find a precise unique unit in the world. The idx parameter allows you to match a specific instance when there are multiple units with the same symbolic name. For players it will find the online player regardless of the idx.

=== Three Parameter Form ===
This form searches for a unit relative to a specific unit within defined environments. It will return the first unit matching the symbolic name in the specified search locations.

== Examples ==
=== Example 1: Basic Usage ===
 bread := findsymbolic("bread@midgaard");

=== Example 2: Finding a Specific Instance ===
 // Presume target is pointing to a particular cityguard
 s := target.symname; // Save the symbolic name
 i := target.idx;
 // Do stuff. Wake up 9 hours later. Find the target again like this:
 target := findsymbolic(s, i);
 // and if the guard is still alive you'll get your pointer back.

=== Example 3: Relative Search ===
 // Mary needs to check if she has her own cooking pot
 pot := findsymbolic(self, "pot@haon_dor", FIND_UNIT_IN_ME);

== Use Cases ==
* Use findsymbolic() when you need to find a specific unit regardless of location
* Use findsymbolic(s, idx) when you need to find a precise instance among duplicates
* Use findsymbolic(u, s, i) when you need to search relative to a specific unit
