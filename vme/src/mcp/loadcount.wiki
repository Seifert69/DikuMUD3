field: integer '''.loadcount''' (Read-only)

== Description ==
The '''loadcount''' field returns the number of units currently loaded in the game that share the same definition (zoneidx, nameidx) as the specified unit. This field is read-only and provides a way to track how many instances of a particular object, NPC, or room template are currently active in the game world.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Field !! Type !! Access !! Description
|-
| loadcount || integer || Read-only || Number of loaded units with same definition
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_load_counts();
 var
   bag: unitptr;
   guard: unitptr;
 code
 {
   bag := load("tot_bag2@hallows23");
   if (bag.loadcount > 250)
   {
     destroy(bag);
     log("Too many bag2 instances loaded: " + bag.loadcount);
   }
   
   guard := load("cityguard@midgaard");
   log("City guards loaded: " + guard.loadcount);
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The loadcount is based on the unit's definition (zoneidx and nameidx combination)
* Units with the same symbolic name but from different zones will have separate load counts
* The count includes the current unit if it's loaded
* This field is useful for population control and preventing excessive loading of certain unit types
* For unique units without a file index, the function returns 1

== Error Handling ==
* Returns '''fail''' if the unitptr is null
* Returns '''fail''' if the unit is not applicable
