= excmdstr_case =
 variable: string '''excmdstr_case'''

'''excmdstr_case''' is a DIL variable that contains the player's command input with original case preserved.

== Description ==
The excmdstr_case variable provides access to the exact text that a player typed as a command, preserving the original letter case. This is different from '''excmdstr''' which converts the input to lowercase.

The variable contains:
* The command word exactly as typed by the player
* Original capitalization and letter case
* Any arguments following the command
* The complete command line as entered

== Examples ==
 dilbegin aware do_password(arg:string);
 var
    prmt:string;
    firstpwd:string;
    i:integer;
    tlist:stringlist;
 code
 {
    if (self.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    // Get the command with original case
    tlist := getwords(excmdstr_case);
    
    if (length(tlist) > 1)
    {
       sendtext("Password must be only one word. Try again.<br/>",self);
       quit;
    }
    
    if (length(excmdstr_case) < 5)
    {
       sendtext("Password too short. Password must be 5 characters or longer. Try again.<br/>",self);
       quit;
    }
    
    if (length(excmdstr_case) > 16)
    {
       sendtext("Password too long. Try again.<br/>",self);
       quit;
    }
    
    firstpwd:=excmdstr_case;
    self.prompt:="Enter password again:  ";
    
    wait(SFB_CMD, self==activator);
    block;
    
    if (strcmp(excmdstr_case, firstpwd) != 0)
    {
       sendtext("Passwords do not match try again.<br/>",self);
       quit;
    }
    
    set_password(self, excmdstr_case);
    sendtext("Password Changed.<br/>",self);
 } dilend
