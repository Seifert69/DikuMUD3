= change_speed =
function: '''change_speed'''(u : unitptr, i : integer);

The '''change_speed''' function modifies the combat speed of a character.

== Description ==
The '''change_speed''' function modifies the combat speed of a character. This is not the same as the character's base speed field, but rather the calculated speed used during combat rounds. This function is primarily used to temporarily delay or accelerate a character's next combat action.

The function only has an effect if the target unit is currently engaged in combat.

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| u || unitptr || The unit on which to alter the current combat speed
|-
| i || integer || The amount to add to the speed
|}

== Examples ==
 dilbegin stun_effect(target : unitptr);
 code
 {
    change_speed(target, 12);
    quit;
 } dilend

 dilbegin potion_quaff_delay();
 code
 {
    if (self.position == POSITION_FIGHTING) 
        change_speed(self, PULSE_VIOLENCE*2);
    quit;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This function only works on units that are currently in combat
* The speed modification is temporary and affects the timing of combat actions
* Commonly used for spells like 'stun' that effectively put a character out of combat for one or more rounds

== Error Handling ==
The function will have no effect if:
* The target unit is not currently in combat
* The parameters are of incorrect types
