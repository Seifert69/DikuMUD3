= capacity =

== Description ==
Returns the maximum weight capacity of a unit. This function determines how much weight a unit can hold (e.g. a chest) or carry (e.g. a character - based on its attributes).

== Syntax ==
 capacity(unit)

== Parameters ==
; unit : unitptr
: The unit whose capacity is being retrieved

== Return Value ==
: integer
: The maximum weight capacity of the unit

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_capacity();
 var
  max_capacity : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  max_capacity := capacity(self);
  sendtext("Your maximum capacity is " + itoa(max_capacity) + " units.<br/>", self);
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This is a read-write property that can be modified
* For CHARS the capacity is based on the character's strength and other attributes
* The value represents the maximum weight a unit can contain
* Commonly used for chests, inventory management, encumbrance checks, and weight calculations
* Higher capacity values allow units to contain more and heavier items
* The function is read-only - use set() to modify capacity if needed
