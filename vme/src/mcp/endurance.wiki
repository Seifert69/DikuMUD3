'''endurance''' is a field accessor that retrieves the current endurance points of a character.

== Description ==
The endurance field provides access to a character's current endurance (stamina) points. Endurance represents physical stamina and is consumed by various activities such as:

* Fighting and combat actions
* Physical exertion and movement
* Special abilities and skills
* Extended activities

Endurance works alongside:
* '''max_endurance''' - The maximum endurance a character can have
* '''hp''' - Health points
* '''mana''' - Magic points

This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)

== Usage Notes ==

** Combat systems
** Fatigue mechanics
** Physical skill systems

== Example ==
 dilbegin nokill();
 var
    pc : unitptr;
 code
 {
    heartbeat := 3 * PULSE_SEC;
 :start:
    wait(SFB_COM, self.position == POSITION_FIGHTING);
    pc := self.fighting;
    if (pc.level > 200) goto start;
    secure(pc,gone);
    if (command("flee"))
       block;

    // Check opponent's endurance before attacking
    if (pc.endurance < 2)
       act("Your opponent looks exhausted.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, pc, TO_CHAR);
    else
    {
       self.hp:= self.max_hp;
       act("$1n grabs a large oak staff from behind $1m.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, pc, TO_VICT);
       act("With a surprisingly swift move he swings, connecting with your head and knocking you unconscious!", A_ALWAYS, self, null, pc, TO_VICT);
       
       pc.hp:= 0;
       pc.endurance:= 0;
       position_update(pc);
    }
 :gone:
    unsecure(pc);
    goto start;
