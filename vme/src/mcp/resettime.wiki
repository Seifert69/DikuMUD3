= resettime =
field: integer '''.resettime''' (Read/Write)

The '''resettime''' field provides access to the reset time interval of a zone, specified in minutes.

== Description ==
The '''resettime''' field is accessed on a zoneptr and returns an integer value representing the zone's reset time in minutes. This field determines how often the zone will automatically reset its contents. The field is read-write, allowing both querying and modification of the reset time interval.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| zone.resettime || integer || Gets or sets the reset time of the zone in minutes
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* zoneptr (Zone Pointer)

== Examples ==
dilbegin zone_reset_info(arg : string);
var
    z : zoneptr;
    buf : string;
code
{
    z := zhead();
    while (z)
    {
        buf := "Zone: " + z.name + " Reset time: " + itoa(z.resettime) + " minutes&n";
        pagestring(buf, self);
        z := z.next;
    }
    quit;
}
dilend

dilbegin set_zone_reset_timer();
var
    zon : zoneptr;
code
{
    // Find the current zone
    zon := zhead();
    while (zon.name != self.zone)
        zon := zon.next;
    
    if (zon.name != self.zone)
    {
        log("ZONE ERROR: Could not find zone " + self.zone);
        return;
    }
    
    // Set heartbeat to zone's reset time in game ticks
    // resettime is in minutes, convert to seconds, then to PULSE_SEC ticks
    heartbeat := zon.resettime * 60 * PULSE_SEC;
    
    wait(SFB_TICK, TRUE);
    // Zone reset logic here
    quit;
}
dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''resettime''' value is specified in minutes, not in game ticks
* To convert resettime to game ticks for use with [[heartbeat]], multiply by 60 and then by [[PULSE_SEC]]
* The field is read-write, allowing dynamic modification of zone reset intervals
* Changes to resettime take effect immediately and affect the next reset cycle
* A resettime of 0 typically means the zone will not reset automatically

== Error Handling ==
* Accessing '''resettime''' on a null zoneptr will result in a DILV_FAIL
* The field will return DILV_ERR if accessed on an inappropriate unit type
* Setting negative values may result in undefined behavior
