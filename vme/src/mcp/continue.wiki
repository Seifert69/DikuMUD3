= continue =
 statement: '''continue''';

The continue statement skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

== Description ==
The '''continue''' statement is used within loop constructs to immediately terminate the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. When executed, any remaining statements in the loop body are skipped, and the loop condition is re-evaluated to determine if another iteration should occur.

This statement is particularly useful for filtering out unwanted iterations in loops, allowing the program to skip processing of items that don't meet certain criteria without exiting the entire loop.

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''continue''' statement can only be used within loop constructs (while loops, foreach loops)
* Using '''continue''' outside of a loop will result in a compilation error: "Using continue outside loop"
* When multiple loops are nested, '''continue''' only affects the innermost loop
* The statement is commonly used for conditional filtering within loops
* '''continue''' differs from '''break''' in that it doesn't exit the loop, just the current iteration

== Error Handling ==
If the '''continue''' statement is used outside of any loop construct, the DIL compiler will generate an error and the script will fail to compile.

== Examples ==
=== Basic while loop with continue ===
dilbegin check_health_status();
code
{
  while (self.inside) {
    if (self.position & POSITION_SLEEPING)
      break;
    pause;
    if (self.hp < 0) 
      continue;
    exec("say I am healthy and ready", self);
    pause;
  }
} dilend

=== Foreach loop with continue for filtering ===
dilbegin collect_valuable_items();
var
    item : unitptr;
    count : integer;
code
{
    count := 0;
    foreach (UNIT_ST_OBJ, item) {
        // Skip items that can't be taken
        if (not isset(item.manipulate, MANIPULATE_TAKE))
            continue;
        
        // Skip buried items
        if (item.flags & UNIT_FL_BURIED)
            continue;
        
        // Skip items we can't see
        if (not visible(self, item))
            continue;
        
        // Skip treasure zone items
        if (item.zoneidx == "treasure")
            continue;
        
        act("$1n picks up $2n.", A_ALWAYS, self, item, null, TO_ALL);
        exec("get " + item.name, self);
        count := count + 1;
    }
    
    act("Collected $2d items.", A_ALWAYS, self, itoa(count), null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

=== Nested loops demonstrating continue scope ===
dilbegin process_players_with_conditions();
var
    pc : unitptr;
    room : unitptr;
code
{
    room := self.outside;
    
    while (self.inside) {
        foreach (UNIT_ST_PC, pc) {
            // Skip self
            if (pc == self)
                continue;
            
            // Skip immortals
            if (pc.level > 200)
                continue;
            
            // Skip players not in the same room
            if (pc.outside != room)
                continue;
            
            act("Processing player: $2n", A_ALWAYS, self, pc, null, TO_CHAR);
            // Process the player...
        }
        pause;
    }
} dilend

=== Continue with conditional logic ===
dilbegin patrol_area();
var
    target : unitptr;
code
{
    while (self.inside) {
        foreach (UNIT_ST_PC|UNIT_ST_NPC, target) {
            // Skip sleeping targets
            if (target.position & POSITION_SLEEPING)
                continue;
            
            // Skip dead targets
            if (target.hp <= 0)
                continue;
            
            // Skip invisible targets
            if (not visible(self, target))
                continue;
            
            act("$1n eyes $3n warily.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, target, TO_NOTVICT);
            pause;
        }
        
        exec("say Patrol complete.", self);
        pause;
    }
} dilend
