= continue =
 statement: '''continue''';

The continue statement skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

== Description ==
The '''continue''' statement is used within loop constructs to immediately terminate the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. When executed, any remaining statements in the loop body are skipped, and the loop condition is re-evaluated to determine if another iteration should occur.

This statement is particularly useful for filtering out unwanted iterations in loops, allowing the program to skip processing of items that don't meet certain criteria without exiting the entire loop.

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''continue''' statement can only be used within loop constructs (while loops, foreach loops)
* Using '''continue''' outside of a loop will result in a compilation error: "Using continue outside loop"
* When multiple loops are nested, '''continue''' only affects the innermost loop
* The statement is commonly used for conditional filtering within loops
* '''continue''' differs from '''break''' in that it doesn't exit the loop, just the current iteration

== Error Handling ==
If the '''continue''' statement is used outside of any loop construct, the DIL compiler will generate an error and the script will fail to compile.

== Examples ==
dilbegin check_health_status();
code
{
  while (self.inside) {
    if (self.position & POSITION_SLEEPING)
      break;
    pause;
    if (self.hp < 0) 
      continue;
    exec("say I am healthy and ready", self);
    pause;
  }
} dilend

dilbegin collect_valuable_items();
var
    item : unitptr;
    count : integer;
code
{
    count := 0;
    foreach (UNIT_ST_OBJ, item) {
        if (not isset(item.manipulate, MANIPULATE_TAKE))
            continue;
        
        if (item.flags & UNIT_FL_BURIED)
            continue;
        
        if (not visible(self, item))
            continue;
        
        act("$1n picks up $2n.", A_ALWAYS, self, item, null, TO_ALL);
        exec("get " + item.name, self);
        count := count + 1;
    }
    
    act("Collected $2d items.", A_ALWAYS, self, itoa(count), null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend
