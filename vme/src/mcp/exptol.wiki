 field: integer '''.exptol''' (Read/Write)

The exptol field represents the experience points needed to reach the next level.

== Description ==
The '''exptol''' field is a read-write integer field available on player characters (PC). It represents the amount of experience points the player needs to reach the next level. This value is dynamically calculated based on the player's current virtual level and total experience.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.exptol || integer || The experience points needed to reach the next level
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_level_progress(pc : unitptr);
 code
 {
    if (pc.type == UNIT_ST_PC)
    {
       if (pc.exptol <= 0)
          sendtext("You can level up now! Use the 'level' command.<br/>", pc);
       else
          sendtext("You need " + itoa(pc.exptol) + " more experience to level.<br/>", pc);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The field is typically dynamically calculated as: required_xp(PC_VIRTUAL_LEVEL(unit) + 1) - CHAR_EXP(unit)
* Modifying this value directly can affect player progression balance
* The value automatically updates as the player gains experience
* When exptol reaches 0 or less, the player can use the 'level' command to advance

== Error Handling ==
* Returns fail if accessed on non-player character units
