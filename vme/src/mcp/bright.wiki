= bright =

== Description ==
Returns the light output value of a unit. This function gets the brightness level for light-producing units like torches or lanterns.

== Syntax ==
 bright(unit)

== Parameters ==
; unit : unitptr
: The unit whose brightness value is being retrieved

== Return Value ==
: integer
: The light output value of the unit

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_torch();
 var
  torch_brightness : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  torch_brightness := bright(self);
  sendtext("Torch brightness: " + itoa(torch_brightness) + "<br/>", self);
 } dilend

 dilbegin adjust_light();
 var
  light_obj : unitptr;
 code
 {
  :start:
  light_obj := findunit(self.outside, "torch", FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);
  if (light_obj.type == UNIT_ST_OBJ and light_obj.objecttype == ITEM_LIGHT)
  {
    setbright(light_obj, 5);
    sendtext("You adjust the torch to brightness 5.<br/>", self);
  }
 } dilend

 dilbegin magical_light();
 var
  current_bright : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  current_bright := bright(self);
  if (current_bright > 0)
  {
    sendtext("The room is illuminated by your light.<br/>", activator);
  }
  else
  {
    sendtext("The light source is not providing illumination.<br/>", activator);
  }
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This is a read-only property that returns light output value
* Only applies to units that can produce light (lights, torches, etc.)
* The brightness value affects how much light the unit provides to its surroundings
* Higher brightness values provide more illumination
* Commonly used with light-producing objects and room lighting calculations
* The function is read-only - use setbright() to modify brightness
