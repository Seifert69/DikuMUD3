= zone =
field: string '''.zone''' (Read-only)

The .zone field returns the name of the zone that a unit belongs to.

== Description ==
The .zone field provides access to the zone name identifier for any unit. This field returns the zone name as a string, which is commonly used for zone-based checks, storage operations, and administrative functions. The zone name represents the zone where the unit was originally defined or currently exists.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.zone || string || Returns the zone name of the unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
=== Check Unit Zone ===
 dilbegin check_unit_zone(unit : unitptr);
 var
    zone_name : string;
 code
 {
    zone_name := unit.zone;
    
    if (zone_name != "")
    {
       sendtext("This unit belongs to zone: " + zone_name + "&n", self);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("This unit has no zone association.&n", self);
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Zone-Specific Storage ===
 dilbegin zone_specific_storage(pc : unitptr);
 var
    player_zone : string;
    storage_key : string;
 code
 {
    player_zone := pc.zone;
    storage_key := "chest_" + player_zone;
    
    sendtext("Your zone-specific storage key is: " + storage_key + "&n", pc);
    
    // Store player's items in zone-specific container
    store(storage_key, pc, FALSE);
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Zone-Restricted Item ===
 dilbegin zone_restricted_item(item : unitptr);
 var
    item_zone : string;
    player_zone : string;
 code
 {
    item_zone := item.zone;
    player_zone := self.zone;
    
    if (item_zone == player_zone)
    {
       sendtext("This item belongs to your current zone (" + item_zone + ").&n", self);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("This item is from zone " + item_zone + " (you are in " + player_zone + ").&n", self);
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The field returns the zone name as defined in the unit's zone file
* Zone names are typically short identifiers like "midgaard", "death", "justice"
* This field is read-only and cannot be modified through DIL
* Commonly used for zone-based storage keys and file operations
* The zone name is used by functions like [[store]] and [[restore]] for zone-specific data
* All units inherit their zone from their original definition location
* This field is essential for multi-zone environments and zone-specific mechanics

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a null unit pointer, the operation will fail
* If the unit has no zone association, may return an empty string
* No other error conditions are expected when accessing this field

== Related Functions/Fields ==
* [[zoneidx]] - The unique database name in zone format
* [[nameidx]] - The unique database zone name for the unit
* [[store]] - Store unit data with zone-specific keys
* [[restore]] - Restore unit data from zone-specific storage
* [[fname]] - The filename of the unit's zone
