field: string '''.zone''' (Read-only)

The .zone field returns the name of the zone that a unit belongs to.

== Description ==
The .zone field provides access to the zone name identifier for any unit. This field returns the zone name as a string, which is commonly used for zone-based checks, storage operations, and administrative functions. The zone name represents the zone where the unit was originally defined or currently exists.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.zone || string || Returns the zone name of the unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes ==
* The field returns the zone name as defined in the unit's zone file
* Zone names are typically short identifiers like "midgaard", "death", "justice"
* This field is read-only and cannot be modified through DIL
* Commonly used for zone-based storage keys and file operations
* The zone name is used by functions like [[store]] and [[restore]] for zone-specific data
* All units inherit their zone from their original definition location
* This field is essential for multi-zone environments and zone-specific mechanics

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a null unit pointer, the operation will fail
* If the unit has no zone association, may return an empty string
* No other error conditions are expected when accessing this field

== Related Functions/Fields ==
* [[zoneidx]] - The unique database name in zone format
* [[nameidx]] - The unique database zone name for the unit
* [[store]] - Store unit data with zone-specific keys
* [[restore]] - Restore unit data from zone-specific storage
* [[fname]] - The filename of the unit's zone
