= delete_player =

'''delete_player''' is a DIL function that permanently deletes a player character from the game world.

== Syntax ==
 delete_player( s : string ) ;

== Parameters ==
; s
: The player name you want to delete

== Description ==
This function deletes a player character from the game. The deletion process includes:
* Removing the player from the global unit list if they are currently loaded
* Closing their descriptor if they are currently online
* Deleting their player file from disk

== Security Considerations ==
The function includes security checks to prevent unauthorized use:
* Only DIL programs running in zones with access level 0 can use this function
* Attempts to use it from higher access level zones will be logged and the DIL program will terminate

== Return Value ==
This function does not return any value. It performs the deletion operation silently.

== Usage Notes ==
* The function does not verify if the player existed or was successfully deleted
* Use the '''isplayer()''' function to check if a player exists before attempting deletion
* The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone

== Example ==
 dilbegin god_delete(pname:string);
 external
  integer submember (s:string,pname:string);
	var
		i:integer;
		err:integer;
		buf:string;
		ln:integer;

		clist:stringlist;
 code
{
	err:=loadstr ("clanlist.data",buf);
	if (err<1)
	{
		delete_player(pname);
		return;
	}

	clist:=split(buf,"\n");
	ln:=length (clist);
	ln:=ln-1;
	if (ln<1)
	{
		delete_player(pname);
		return;
	}
	i:=0;
	while (i<ln)
	{
		err:=submember(clist.[i],pname);
		i:=i+1;
	}
	delete_player(pname);
	return;
} dilend
