= unsecure =
 procedure: '''unsecure'''(u : unitptr);

The '''unsecure''' procedure removes secure protection from a previously secured unit.

== Description ==
This procedure removes the secure protection that was placed on a unit using the [[secure]]() procedure. Once a unit is unsecured, it can be modified, destroyed, or moved by other DIL programs. The secure/unsecure mechanism is used to prevent race conditions and protect units during critical operations.

== PARAMETERS ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| u || unitptr || The unit to remove secure protection from
|}

== Examples ==
=== Basic Item Processing ===
dilbegin unique process_item(item : unitptr);
var
    original_owner : unitptr;
code
{
    // Secure the item to prevent interference
    secure(item, :item_lost);
    
    // Process the item safely
    original_owner := item.outside;
    sendto("Processing " + item.title + "...&n", self);
    
    // Remove secure protection when done
    unsecure(item);
    
    // Continue with normal operations
    act("$1n finishes processing $2n.", A_ALWAYS, self, item, null, TO_ROOM);
} dilend

=== Temporary Protection ===
dilbegin unique temporary_protection();
var
    protected_unit : unitptr;
code
{
    protected_unit := self;
    
    // Secure the unit
    secure(protected_unit, :protection_active);
    sendto("You are now protected from interference.&n", protected_unit);
    
    // Simulate some processing time
    heartbeat := PULSE_SEC * 5;
    pause;
    
    // Remove protection
    unsecure(protected_unit);
    sendto("Protection removed.&n", protected_unit);
} dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The unit parameter must have been previously secured using the [[secure]]() procedure.
* Each call to [[secure]]() should have a corresponding call to '''unsecure'''() to avoid leaving units permanently secured.
* The secure/unsecure mechanism prevents other DIL programs from modifying the unit during critical operations.
* Commonly used when:
** Processing items that might be targeted by other programs
** Transferring items between characters
** Performing complex operations that shouldn't be interrupted
** Temporarily protecting units during calculations or modifications
* If the unit leaves the local environment (destroyed, moved to different location, etc.), the secure is automatically broken and execution jumps to the specified label.
* The procedure is essential for proper resource management and preventing deadlocks.

== Error Handling ==
* If the unit parameter is not a unitptr, a DIL fatal error occurs: "Arg 1 of 'unsecure' not a unit".
* If the unit was not previously secured, the procedure has no effect but does not cause an error.
* If the unit pointer is null, the procedure fails silently.
* The procedure will fail if the unit is not in the current DIL program's local environment.
