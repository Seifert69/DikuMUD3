 field: integer '''.ability_points''' (Read/Write)

The '''ability_points''' field is a read-write integer field available on player character units that represents the number of unused ability points the player has available for training.

== Description ==
This field represents the number of unused ability points that a player has available for training abilities. Points can be awarded for leveling up, completing quests, or special events.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| player.ability_points || integer || The number of unused ability points available
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Examples ==
=== Basic Points Check ===
 dilbegin check_ability_points(player : unitptr);
 code
 {
    if (player.type != UNIT_ST_PC) {
       send("This function only works on players.");
       quit;
    }
    
    send("You have " + itoa(player.ability_points) + " unused ability points.");
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Points Award ===
 dilbegin award_ability_points(player : unitptr, amount : integer);
 code
 {
    if (player.type != UNIT_ST_PC) {
       send("This function only works on players.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (amount > 0) {
       player.ability_points := player.ability_points + amount;
       send("You gain " + itoa(amount) + " ability points!");
    } else {
       send("Invalid amount.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Points Spend ===
 dilbegin spend_ability_points(player : unitptr, amount : integer);
 code
 {
    if (player.type != UNIT_ST_PC) {
       send("This function only works on players.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (amount < 0) {
       send("Invalid amount.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (player.ability_points >= amount) {
       player.ability_points := player.ability_points - amount;
       send("You spend " + itoa(amount) + " ability points.");
       send("Remaining: " + itoa(player.ability_points));
    } else {
       send("You don't have enough ability points.");
       send("You have: " + itoa(player.ability_points) + " available.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
The field performs validation:
* '''Player validation'' - Ensures unit is a valid PC (not NPC)
* '''Type validation'' - Returns fail if accessed on non-PC units
* '''Range validation'' - No explicit range validation, but practical limits apply

Note: The C implementation shows that this field:
* Only works on player characters (PCs), not NPCs
* Returns a reference (DILV_SINT4R) to the actual ability points value
* Uses getAbilityPointsPtr() function to access the underlying data
* Is a read-write field, allowing both reading and modification

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is read-write for both reading and modifying ability points
* Only available on player character units (UNIT_ST_PC type)
* Ability points are typically awarded for leveling up, completing quests, or special events
* The field is commonly used in training systems, character advancement, and point management
* Often used together with skill_points field for total practice point management
* Ability points are spent to improve base abilities through training or practice
* The field persists across saves and character logins
* Typical values range from 0 to potentially high numbers depending on character progression
