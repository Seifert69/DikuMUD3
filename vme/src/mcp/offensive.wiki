 field: integer '''.offensive''' (Read/Write)

The '''offensive''' field provides access to the offensive bonus modifier for characters.

== Description ==
The '''offensive''' field represents a bonus or penalty applied to the character's offensive combat capabilities, affecting their ability to successfully hit targets in combat. Based on the C implementation, this field returns a reference to the character's offensive bonus value, allowing both reading and writing of the modifier.

== Field Access ==
This is a field access on character unitptrs:
 char.offensive

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)

== Usage Notes ==
This field represents a combat modifier that affects attack accuracy and effectiveness.
Positive values improve offensive capabilities, while negative values impose penalties.
This field is part of the combat system alongside [[defensive]] and [[attack_type]].

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_offensive(target : unitptr);
 var
    off_bonus : integer;
 
 code
 {
    if ((target.type != UNIT_ST_PC) and (target.type != UNIT_ST_NPC))
    {
       act("$1n is not a character.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
       return;
    }
    
    off_bonus := target.offensive;
    
    if (off_bonus > 0)
       act("$1n has a +$2d offensive bonus.", A_ALWAYS, self, off_bonus, target, TO_CHAR);
    else if (off_bonus < 0)
       act("$1n has a $2d offensive penalty.", A_ALWAYS, self, off_bonus, target, TO_CHAR);
    else
       act("$1n has no offensive modifier.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
Always verify the unit is a character before accessing offensive:

 if ((unit.type == UNIT_ST_PC) or (unit.type == UNIT_ST_NPC))
 {
    bonus := unit.offensive;
 }
 else
 {
    act("Not a character unit.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
