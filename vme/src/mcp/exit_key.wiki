 field: string '''.exit_key'''[direction] (Read-only)

The exit_key field provides access to the key identifier for room exits.

== Description ==
The '''exit_key''' field provides access to the key identifier associated with a room exit. This identifier is the symbolic name of the key object that can be used to lock or unlock the exit. The key can be located using the findsymbolic() function.

The key string format follows the standard DikuMUD symbolic naming convention: "key_name@zone_name"

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| room.exit_key[direction] || string || The symbolic name of the key required for the exit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_exit_key(room : unitptr, dir : integer);
 var
    key_name : string;
    key_obj : unitptr;
 code
 {
    key_name := room.exit_key[dir];
    if (key_name != "")
    {
       key_obj := findsymbolic(self, key_name, FIND_UNIT_IN_ME);
       if (key_obj != null)
          act("You have the proper key.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       else
          act("You don't have the key.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the directional constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* An empty string indicates that no key is required for the exit
* This field is read-only - keys cannot be changed through DIL programs

== Error Handling ==
* Returns empty string if the exit doesn't exist or no key is required
* Returns fail if accessed on non-room units
