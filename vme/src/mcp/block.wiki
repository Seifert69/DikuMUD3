= block =

== Description ==
Blocks commands issued by a player or mobile. This function prevents commands from being processed by the interpreter and is useful for creating special command handlers.

== Syntax ==
 block

== Parameters ==
None

== Return Value ==
None

== Examples ==
 dilbegin command_interceptor();
 var
 code
 {
  :start:
  wait(SFB_CMD, command("test"));
  block;
  sendtext("The 'test' command has been blocked.<br/>", activator);
 } dilend

 dilbegin special_handler();
 var
  cmd : string;
 code
 {
  :start:
  wait(SFB_CMD, TRUE);
  cmd := argument;
  
  if (cmd == "special")
  {
    block;
    // Handle special command logic here
    sendtext("Special command processed.<br/>", activator);
  }
  else
  {
    // Let normal command processing continue
    sendtext("Normal command: " + cmd + "<br/>", activator);
  }
 } dilend

 dilbegin block_example();
 var
  blocked_cmd : string;
 code
 {
  :start:
  wait(SFB_CMD, TRUE);
  blocked_cmd := argument;
  
  if (blocked_cmd != "")
  {
    block;
    exec("say I'm not allowed to use that command.", self);
    exec("emote looks confused.", self);
  }
  else
  {
    sendtext("No command to block.<br/>", self);
  }
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* The block function prevents the current command from being processed
* When blocked, the command is intercepted and not passed to the normal interpreter
* Useful for creating custom command handlers or restricting certain commands
* Can be used to intercept commands for special processing
* Often used with SFB_CMD triggers to handle commands before normal processing
* The blocking is temporary - subsequent commands will process normally unless blocked again
* Commonly used for command validation, special effects, or command restrictions
