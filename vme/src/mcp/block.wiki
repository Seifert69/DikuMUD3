= block =
 function: '''block'''();

The '''block''' function prevents commands from being processed by the interpreter.

== Description ==
Blocks commands issued by a player or mobile. This function prevents commands from being processed by the interpreter and is useful for creating special command handlers.

== Parameters ==
This function takes no parameters.

== Return Value ==
This function does not return a value.

== Examples ==
=== Basic Command Blocking ===
 dilbegin command_interceptor();
 code
 {
    wait(SFB_CMD, command("test"));
    block;
    send("The 'test' command has been blocked.");
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Special Command Handler ===
 dilbegin special_handler();
 var
    cmd : string;
 code
 {
    wait(SFB_CMD, TRUE);
    cmd := argument;
    
    if (cmd == "special") {
       block;
       // Handle special command logic here
       send("Special command processed.");
    } else {
       // Let normal command processing continue
       send("Normal command: " + cmd);
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Command Restriction ===
 dilbegin block_example();
 var
    blocked_cmd : string;
 code
 {
    wait(SFB_CMD, TRUE);
    blocked_cmd := argument;
    
    if (blocked_cmd != "") {
       block;
       exec("say I'm not allowed to use that command.", self);
       exec("emote looks confused.", self);
    } else {
       send("No command to block.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Command Validation ===
 dilbegin validate_command();
 var
    player_input : string;
 code
 {
    wait(SFB_CMD, TRUE);
    player_input := argument;
    
    if (player_input == "forbidden") {
       block;
       send("That command is forbidden.");
    } else if (player_input == "restricted") {
       block;
       send("That command is restricted.");
    } else {
       send("Command accepted: " + player_input);
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The block function prevents the current command from being processed
* When blocked, the command is intercepted and not passed to the normal interpreter
* Useful for creating custom command handlers or restricting certain commands
* Can be used to intercept commands for special processing
* Often used with SFB_CMD triggers to handle commands before normal processing
* The blocking is temporary - subsequent commands will process normally unless blocked again
* Commonly used for command validation, special effects, or command restrictions

== Error Handling ==
The function performs validation:
* '''Context validation''' - Only works within command-triggered DIL programs
* '''State validation''' - Ensures proper command context
* '''Runtime validation''' - Validates command processing state
