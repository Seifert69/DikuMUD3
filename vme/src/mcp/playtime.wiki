= playtime =

 field: integer '''.playtime'''
 type: '''integer'''
 access: '''Read-only'''

== Syntax ==
 unit.playtime

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| Read || integer || Returns the total time played in seconds
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Description ==
The '''playtime''' field contains the total amount of time a player character has been connected to the game, measured in seconds. This value accumulates over the player's entire gaming session history and is persistent across logins.

The time is calculated by the underlying C++ function getTotalTimePlayedInSeconds() and represents the cumulative time the player has been actively playing the game.

== Examples ==
 dilbegin show_playtime();
 var
    total_seconds : integer;
    hours : integer;
    minutes : integer;
    seconds : integer;
 code
 {
    // Get total playtime in seconds
    total_seconds := self.playtime;
    
    // Convert to hours, minutes, seconds
    hours := total_seconds / 3600;
    minutes := (total_seconds % 3600) / 60;

== Usage Notes ==
* The playtime field is read-only and cannot be modified by DIL code
* The value is measured in seconds since the player's creation
* Time accumulates across all gaming sessions and is persistent
* To convert to hours, divide by 3600 (60 * 60)
* To convert to days, divide by 86400 (24 * 60 * 60)
* The field is only available on player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* The value includes all time the player has been connected to the game

== Error Handling ==
The field access will return '''fail''' when:
* Attempting to access playtime on a non-player character unit
* The unit is null or invalid
