= send_done =
 function: void '''send_done'''(c : string, a : unitptr, m : unitptr, t : unitptr, p : integer, arg : string, o : unitptr, i : integer);

The '''send_done''' function sends completion messages to DIL programs that are waiting for specific operations to finish.

== Description ==
The send_done function sends an SFB_DONE message to DIL programs in the surrounding area that are waiting for a specific command or operation to complete. This is commonly used in command implementations to notify other DIL programs that an operation has finished, allowing them to resume execution or perform cleanup tasks.

== PARAMETERS ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| c || string || Command string that identifies the completed operation
|-
| a || unitptr || Activator unit that triggered the operation
|-
| m || unitptr || Medium unit involved in the operation
|-
| t || unitptr || Target unit of the operation
|-
| p || integer || Power/parameter value for the message
|-
| arg || string || Argument string passed with the message
|-
| o || unitptr || Other unit to receive the message
|-
| i || integer || CMD_AUTO_XXX value or 0 for no auto command
|}

== Examples ==
=== Basic Command Completion ===
 dilbegin read_command(target_name : string);
 var
     board : unitptr;
 code
 {
     board := findunit(self, target_name, FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);
     if (board == null)
     {
         sendtext("No board found.&n", self);
         quit;
     }
     
     // Notify other programs that reading has started
     send_done("read", self, null, board, 0, argument, null, 0);
     
     // Notify completion
     send_done("read", self, null, board, 0, argument, null, 0);
 }
 dilend

=== Multi-Program Coordination ===
 dilbegin complex_operation(item : unitptr);
 var
     worker : unitptr;
 code
 {
     // Start operation and notify worker programs
     send_done("process", self, null, item, 1, "start", null, 0);
     
     // Notify completion
     send_done("process", self, null, item, 1, "complete", null, 0);
 }
 dilend

=== State Management ===
 dilbegin state_machine(target_state : string);
 code
 {
     // Transition to new state
     send_done("transition", self, null, null, 1, target_state, null, 0);
     
     // Notify state change complete
     send_done("state_change", self, null, null, 2, target_state, null, 0);
 }
 dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The function sends SFB_DONE messages to waiting DIL programs
* Programs must be waiting with interrupt(SFB_DONE, ...) to receive these messages
* The command string 'c' identifies the operation being completed
* Parameter 'i' uses CMD_AUTO_* constants or 0 for no auto command
* The function is commonly used for multi-program coordination and command completion
* Messages are sent to all DIL programs in the surrounding area
* Use with [[interrupt]] function to handle incoming completion messages

== Error Handling ==
* Function will fail if any required parameters are null or invalid
* Invalid command strings may cause unpredictable behavior
* No return value - function is void and cannot indicate success/failure
* Ensure target programs are properly waiting for SFB_DONE messages
