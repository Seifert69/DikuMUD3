= findunit =
 function: unitptr '''findunit'''(u : unitptr, s : string, i : integer, l : unitptr);

The '''findunit''' function searches for a unit by name within a specific environment or container list.

== Description ==
The first argument is typically the char that's looking for something, i.e. if Mary needs a spoon to stir the pot, she'll be the first argument.

The second argument is what you're looking for, represented by a string. In the above mentioned example, that'd be "spoon".

For the third or fourth argument, you have a choice, as you'll only need to use one of them, and let the other be 0 or null. For instance, if you have a pointer to Mary's kitchen utensil pot, you can use the line:

 findunit(mary, "spoon", 0, pot);

Or you can just let her look around for it with:

 findunit(mary, "spoon", FIND_UNIT_INVEN or FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);

== PARAMETERS ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| u || unitptr || The unit the local environment is relative to
|-
| s || string || A string with name of the unit to find
|-
| i || integer || The environment, where to look for it, see FIND_UNIT_* in values.h and/or vme.h
|-
| l || unitptr || An optional list of units to search
|}

== Examples ==
spoon := findunit(mary, "spoon", 0, pot);

spoon := findunit(mary, "spoon", FIND_UNIT_INVEN or FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);

safe := findunit(self, "safe", FIND_UNIT_SURRO, self);

== Usage Notes ==
* Use either the environment parameter (i) or the list parameter (l), not both
* Set the unused parameter to 0 or null
* FIND_UNIT_PAY and FIND_UNIT_NOPAY are ignored in this function
* The search is case-insensitive for unit names

== Error Handling ==
* Returns null if no matching unit is found
* Invalid FIND_UNIT_* values may cause unexpected behavior
* Always check the returned unitptr before use
