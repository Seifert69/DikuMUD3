 field: integer '''.max_endurance''' [Read-only]

The '''.max_endurance''' field is accessed on character units (PC or NPC) and returns the maximum endurance points of the character. This represents the highest possible endurance value the character can have, which is used as the upper bound for current endurance calculations.

== Description ==
Endurance is typically used for physical activities, movement, and combat stamina.

== Field Access ==

| .max_endurance || integer || Read-only || Maximum endurance points of the character
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin show_endurance_status(char : unitptr);
 code
 {
   // Check if the unit is a character
   if (char.type != UNIT_ST_PC and char.type != UNIT_ST_NPC)
   {
     act("Target is not a character.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
     quit;
   }

   // Display endurance information
   act("$1n's endurance: $2d/$3d", A_ALWAYS, char, char.endurance, char.max_endurance, TO_ROOM);
   
   // Calculate endurance percentage
   if (char.max_endurance > 0)
   {
     var percentage : integer;
     percentage := (char.endurance * 100) / char.max_endurance;
     act("Endurance at $2d% capacity.", A_ALWAYS, char, percentage, null, TO_CHAR);
   }

   quit;
 }
 dilend

 dilbegin restore_endurance(char : unitptr);
 code
 {
   if (char.type != UNIT_ST_PC and char.type != UNIT_ST_NPC)
   {
     act("Target is not a character.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
     quit;
   }

   // Restore endurance to maximum
   char.endurance := char.max_endurance;
   act("$1n's endurance has been fully restored.", A_ALWAYS, char, null, null, TO_ROOM);
   act("Your endurance has been fully restored.", A_ALWAYS, char, null, null, TO_CHAR);

   quit;
 }
 dilend

 dilbegin endurance_check(threshold : integer);
 code
 {
   // Check if self has sufficient endurance
   if (self.endurance < threshold)
   {
     act("You don't have enough endurance for that action.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
     act("You need at least $2d endurance.", A_ALWAYS, self, threshold, null, TO_CHAR);
     quit;
   }

   // Calculate remaining endurance
   var remaining : integer;
   remaining := self.max_endurance - self.endurance;
   act("You have $2d endurance points remaining.", A_ALWAYS, self, remaining, null, TO_CHAR);

   quit;
 }
 dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''.max_endurance''' field is read-only and cannot be modified directly
* This field represents the theoretical maximum endurance a character can have
* Maximum endurance is typically determined by character level, race, and other attributes
* This field is commonly used in conjunction with [[endurance]] to calculate percentages and ratios
* The value is used as the upper bound when restoring endurance after death, rest, or magical effects
* Endurance systems are often used for movement costs, combat fatigue, and special abilities

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a non-character unit type, the operation will return '''fail'''
* If accessed on a null '''unitptr''', the operation will return '''fail'''
* The field itself never fails - it always returns an integer value

== Related Functions/Fields ==

* [[max_hp]] - Gets the maximum hit points
* [[max_mana]] - Gets the maximum mana points
* [[hp]] - Gets/sets the current hit points
* [[mana]] - Gets/sets the current mana points
