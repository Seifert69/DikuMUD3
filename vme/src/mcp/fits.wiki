= fits =

== Syntax ==
 string fits( char : unitptr, obj : unitptr, pos : integer )

== Parameters ==
; char : unitptr
: Character which we want to test if obj can be fitted upon
; obj : unitptr
: The object we want to see if fits char
; pos : integer
: -1 or WEAR_XXX position where object would be worn

== Return Value ==
Returns empty string if object fits, or a textual description of the size problem if it doesn't fit.

== Description ==
This function tests if "obj" can be worn by "char" in position "pos". If pos is -1, then fits automatically figures out the default worn position for "obj".

The function is useful for checking whether an armor or clothing item will fit a character before attempting to equip it or sell it to them.

== Examples ==
=== Example 1: Basic Fit Check ===
 s := fits(self, obj, -1);
 if (s != "")
   exec("say Don't buy it, its "+s, self);

=== Example 2: Check Specific Position ===
 // Check if helmet fits
 result := fits(player, helmet, WEAR_HEAD);
 if (result == "")
 {
    // Helmet fits, can proceed
 }
 else
 {
    // Helmet doesn't fit, explain why
    exec("say This helmet won't fit you: " + result, self);
 }

== Return Values ==
The function returns:
* Empty string ("") if the object fits the character
* Textual description of why it doesn't fit (e.g., "too small", "too large")
