= idx =

 field: integer '''idx''' (Read-only)

== Description ==
The '''idx''' field returns a constant integer ID for a unit. For players, this ID is persistent across reboots. For non-player characters (NPCs) and objects, this is the memory pointer converted to an integer.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.idx || integer || Unique identifier for the unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes

* For players: Returns a persistent ID that remains the same across reboots
* For NPCs and objects: Returns the memory pointer converted to integer (changes between reboots)
* This field is read-only (RO)
* Useful for distinguishing between multiple instances of the same unit type
* Commonly used with findsymbolic() to locate specific units later
* Do not rely on idx for persistence across reboots for non-player units

== Examples

=== Identifying Specific Units

 dilbegin track_guard();
 var
    guard_symname : string;
    guard_idx : integer;
    target : unitptr;
 code
 {
    // Get reference to a specific guard
    target := findsymbolic("cityguard@midgaard");
    if (target)
    {
       guard_symname := target.symname;
       guard_idx := target.idx;
       
       // Later, find the exact same guard
       target := findsymbolic(guard_symname, guard_idx);
       if (target)
       {
          act("Found the same guard again!", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       }
    }
 } dilend

=== Justice System Example

 id := "$reward "+ self.symname + " " + itoa(self.idx) + " "+ juris;

=== Bounty Hunter Pattern

 // Presume target is pointing to a particular cityguard
 s := target.symname; // Save the symbolic name
 i := target.idx;
 // Do stuff. Wake up 9 hours later. Find the target again like this:
 target := findsymbolic(s, i);
 // and if the guard is still alive you'll get your pointer back.
