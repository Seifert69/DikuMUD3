 field: integer '''.objcount''' (Read-only)

The '''objcount''' field returns the number of objects defined in a specific zone.

== Description ==
The '''objcount''' field provides access to the count of objects that belong to the specified zone. Based on the C implementation, this field operates on a zone pointer and calls the `getNumOfObjects()` method to retrieve the object count for that zone.

== Field Access ==
This is a field access on zoneptrs:
 zone.objcount

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* zoneptr

== Examples ==
 dilbegin zone_object_info();
 var
    current_zone : zoneptr;
    obj_num : integer;
 
 code
 {
    current_zone := zhead();
    
    while (current_zone != null)
    {
       obj_num := current_zone.objcount;
       act("Zone $1t has $2d objects", A_ALWAYS, self, obj_num, current_zone, TO_CHAR);
       current_zone := current_zone.next;
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is currently marked as obsolete and not used in any DIL programs
* The count includes all objects defined in the zone's file, regardless of whether they are currently loaded
* Use with [[findzone]] to get a zone pointer by name
* Combine with [[roomcount]] and [[npccount]] for complete zone statistics

== Error Handling ==
Always check the zone pointer for null before accessing objcount:

 if (zone_ptr != null)
 {
    count := zone_ptr.objcount;
 }
 else
 {
    act("Invalid zone pointer.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
