= realtime =
variable: '''realtime''' : integer (Read-only)

Returns the current real-world time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

== Description ==
The '''realtime''' variable provides access to the current system time in Unix timestamp format. This represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). For C programmers, this is equivalent to calling time(NULL).

This variable is particularly useful for implementing time-based restrictions, tracking elapsed time, or scheduling events based on real-world time rather than game time.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| realtime || integer (Read-only) || Current Unix timestamp in seconds since epoch
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available globally in all DIL programs and does not require a specific unit type.

== Examples ==
=== Basic Time Display ===
dilbegin show_current_time();
code
{
   act("Current time: " + asctime(realtime), A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

=== Time-Based Access Control ===
dilbegin time_limited_area();
var
   last_reset : integer;

code
{
   last_reset := realtime;
   
   :main_loop:
   wait(SFB_TICK, TRUE);
   
   // Reset area every 24 hours
   if (realtime > last_reset + 86400)  // 86400 seconds = 24 hours
   {
      act("The area has been reset!", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_ALL);
      last_reset := realtime;
   }
   
   goto main_loop;
} dilend

=== Player Time Limit Enforcement ===
dilbegin enforce_playtime_limit();
var
   session_start : integer;
   max_playtime  : integer;

code
{
   session_start := realtime;
   max_playtime := 14400;  // 4 hours in seconds
   
   :monitor:
   wait(SFB_TICK, TRUE);
   
   if (realtime - session_start > max_playtime)
   {
      act("You have reached your time limit for today.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
      block;
   }
   
   goto monitor;
} dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The value returned by '''realtime''' is a 32-bit integer representing seconds since the Unix epoch
* This value is independent of game time or MUD uptime
* The timestamp is in UTC, not local server time
* Useful for coordinating with external systems or implementing real-world time constraints
* Can be used with the [[Manual:DIL_Manual/asctime|asctime]] function to convert to human-readable format

== Error Handling ==
The '''realtime''' variable does not generate errors under normal circumstances. However:
* On systems with incorrect system time, the returned value may be invalid
* The value may wrap around on systems with 32-bit time_t after January 19, 2038 (Year 2038 problem)
