field: integer '''.weapon_costs'''[idx] (Read-only)

The .weapon_costs field provides access to the cost multiplier for weapon skills based on racial bonuses.

== Description ==
The .weapon_costs field returns the racial weapon cost modifier for a specific weapon type. This value represents how much it costs a character of a particular race to advance in that weapon skill. The function uses the character's race and the weapon index to determine the appropriate cost multiplier from the racial weapon tables.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| pc.weapon_costs[idx] || integer || Returns the racial cost multiplier for weapon type 'idx'
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Parameters ==
The field requires an integer index parameter:
; idx : integer
: The weapon type index (WPN_* constants from values.h and/or vme.h)

== Examples ==
=== Basic Weapon Cost Check ===
 dilbegin racial_weapon_check(pc : unitptr);
 var
    i : integer;
    cost : integer;
 code
    // Check weapon costs for all weapon types
    for (i := 0; i < 10; i := i + 1)
    {
      cost := pc.weapon_costs[i];
      if (cost > 0)
      {
        sendtext("Weapon " + itoa(i) + " cost: " + itoa(cost) + "&n", self);
      }
    }
    quit;
 dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The field is only accessible for player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* The weapon index must be within the valid range (0 to WPN_TREE_MAX - 1)
* The returned value represents a cost multiplier, not the absolute cost
* This field is typically used in character creation or skill advancement systems
* The function internally calls get_racial_weapon() to determine the cost

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a non-PC unit, the operation will fail
* If the weapon index is out of range, the operation will fail
* Invalid parameter types will result in an error
