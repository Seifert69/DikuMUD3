field: integer '''.skill_points''' (Read-only)

The '''skill_points''' field is used to get the number of unused skill points available to a player character.

== Description ==
This field provides access to the current amount of unused skill points that a player character has available for learning or improving skills. The field returns an integer representing the pool of skill points that can be spent on new abilities or skill advancements.

The field is read-only and reflects the character's current available skill points, which are typically gained through experience accumulation or other game mechanics.

== Field Access ==

| Read || integer || Returns the current number of unused skill points
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Examples ==
=== Basic Skill Points Display ===
 dilbegin show_skill_points();
 var
    available_points : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    available_points := activator.skill_points;
    
    sendtext("You have " + itoa(available_points) + " unused skill points.<br/>", activator);
 } dilend

=== Skill Points Check ===
 dilbegin can_afford_training(cost : integer);
 var
    available_points : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    available_points := activator.skill_points;
    
    if (available_points >= cost)
    {
       sendtext("You have enough skill points for this training.<br/>", activator);
       return(1);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("You need " + itoa(cost - available_points) + " more skill points.<br/>", activator);
       return(0);
    }
 } dilend

=== Skill Points Management ===
 dilbegin skill_point_transaction();
 var
    current_points : integer;
    spent_points : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    current_points := activator.skill_points;
    
    // Simulate spending 5 skill points
    spent_points := 5;
    
    // Note: This is just a simulation - actual spending
    // would use game mechanics or other functions
    sendtext("You had " + itoa(current_points) + " skill points.<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("You spent " + itoa(spent_points) + " skill points.<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("You now have " + itoa(current_points - spent_points) + " skill points.<br/>", activator);
 } dilend

=== Character Status Display ===
 dilbegin character_status();
 var
    skill_points : integer;
    ability_points : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    skill_points := activator.skill_points;
    ability_points := activator.ability_points;
    
    sendtext("Character Status:<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("Skill Points: " + itoa(skill_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("Ability Points: " + itoa(ability_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    
    // Check if character has points to spend
    if (skill_points > 0 or ability_points > 0)
    {
       sendtext("You can improve your abilities. Type 'practice' to train.<br/>", activator);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("You have no points to spend. Gain more experience to earn points.<br/>", activator);
    }
 } dilend

=== Points Validation ===
 dilbegin validate_skill_points();
 var
    skill_points : integer;
    ability_points : integer;
    total_points : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    skill_points := activator.skill_points;
    ability_points := activator.ability_points;
    total_points := skill_points + ability_points;
    
    sendtext("Skill Points: " + itoa(skill_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("Ability Points: " + itoa(ability_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("Total Points: " + itoa(total_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    
    if (total_points < 0)
    {
       sendtext("Warning: Negative point total detected.<br/>", activator);
    }
    else if (total_points > 100)
    {
       sendtext("Warning: Very high point total.<br/>", activator);
    }
 } dilend

=== Level Up Check ===
 dilbegin check_level_up();
 var
    skill_points : integer;
    exp_needed : integer;
    current_exp : integer;
 code
 {
    if (activator.type != UNIT_ST_PC)
       quit;
    
    skill_points := activator.skill_points;
    current_exp := activator.exp;
    exp_needed := activator.exptol;
    
    sendtext("Experience to next level: " + itoa(exp_needed - current_exp) + "<br/>", activator);
    sendtext("Current skill points: " + itoa(skill_points) + "<br/>", activator);
    
    if (skill_points >= 10)
    {
       sendtext("You have enough points to train multiple skills!<br/>", activator);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("You need more skill points for advanced training.<br/>", activator);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The field is read-only and cannot be modified directly
* Only available on player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* Skill points are typically earned through experience gain
* Points are spent on learning new skills or improving existing ones
* The field works with [[ability_points]] for total character development points
* Skill points are separate from ability points in most game systems
* The field is commonly used in character creation, training, and advancement systems
* Point values are typically non-negative integers

== Error Handling ==
The field includes validation checks:

* **Unit type validation**: Only works on UNIT_ST_PC units
* **Null pointer validation**: Fails when accessed on null unit pointers
* **Read-only access**: Cannot be modified directly

Common error scenarios:
* Accessing the field on NPCs or objects (will return fail)
* Attempting to modify the field (it's read-only)
* Accessing the field on destroyed units
* Using the field for non-player characters
