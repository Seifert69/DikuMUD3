= exit_to =
 field: unitptr '''.exit_to'''[direction] (Read-only)

The exit_to field provides access to the destination rooms for each direction exit.

== Description ==
The '''exit_to''' field is a read-only array field available on room units that provides access to the destination rooms for each direction exit.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| room.exit_to[direction] || unitptr || The destination room for the specified direction
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_exits(room : unitptr);
 code
 {
    if (room.exit_to[NORTH] != null)
       send("There is an exit to the north.");
    if (room.exit_to[SOUTH] == null)
       send("There is no exit to the south.");
 } dilend

 dilbegin teleport_random(room : unitptr);
 var
    exits : integer[6];
    count : integer;
    dir : integer;
 code
 {
    count := 0;
    for (dir := 0; dir < 6; dir := dir + 1)
    {
       if (room.exit_to[dir] != null)
       {
          exits[count] := dir;
          count := count + 1;
       }
    }
    
    if (count > 0)
    {
       dir := exits[rand(count)];
       link(self, room.exit_to[dir]);
    }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The direction parameter must be one of the directional constants (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST, UP, DOWN)
* This field is read-only - you cannot change exit destinations through DIL
* Always check for null return values before using the destination room

== Error Handling ==
* Returns null if no exit exists in the specified direction
* Returns fail if accessed on non-room units
* Returns fail if the direction index is out of range

== Related Functions/Fields ==

* [[exit_info]] - Array of exit flag bits for each direction
* [[link]] - Function to move units between rooms
