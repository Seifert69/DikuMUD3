= openflags =
 field: integer '''.openflags''' (Read/Write)

The '''openflags''' field provides access to the open/close/lock state flags for units.

== Description ==
The '''openflags''' field contains bit flags that determine whether a unit (typically doors, containers, or objects with lids) is open, closed, locked, or has other special properties. Based on the C implementation, this field returns a reference to the unit's open flags value, allowing both reading and writing of the flag bits.

== Field Access ==
This is a field access on unitptrs:
 unit.openflags

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes ==
This field uses bit flags that can be tested and modified using [[isset]] and bitwise operations.
Common flag constants include:
* '''EX_CLOSED''' - Unit is closed
* '''EX_LOCKED''' - Unit is locked
* '''EX_OPEN_CLOSE''' - Unit can be opened and closed
* '''EX_PICKPROOF''' - Unit cannot be picked

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_open_state(target : unitptr);
 var
    flags : integer;
 
 code
 {
    if (target == null)
    {
       act("No target specified.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       return;
    }
    
    flags := target.openflags;
    
    if (isset(flags, EX_CLOSED))
       act("$1n is closed.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    else
       act("$1n is open.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    
    if (isset(flags, EX_LOCKED))
       act("$1n is locked.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    else
       act("$1n is unlocked.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
Always verify the unit pointer is valid before accessing openflags:

 if (unit != null)
 {
    flags := unit.openflags;
 }
 else
 {
    act("Invalid unit pointer.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
