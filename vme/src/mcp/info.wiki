 field: extraptr '''info''' (Read/Write)

The '''info''' field provides access to a player character's personal information storage, which can contain custom data fields such as email addresses, maiden names, and other player-specific information.

== Description ==

The '''info''' field is accessed on player character units and returns an extraptr to the player's information structure. This structure is used to store persistent player data that is not part of the core character statistics but is needed for game management and player identification.

The info structure is implemented as a linked list of extra descriptions, where each entry can have:
* An array of names (stringlist)
* An array of values (integerlist) 
* A description string

== Field Access ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.info || extraptr || Returns pointer to player's info structure
|}

== Availability ==

This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Examples ==

=== Basic Access ===
dilbegin example();
var
   pc : unitptr;
   info_ptr : extraptr;
code
{
   pc := activator;
   if (pc.type != UNIT_ST_PC) goto lost_pc;
   
   info_ptr := pc.info;
   if (info_ptr != null)
   {
      // Access player info
   }
:lost_pc:
} dilend

=== Searching for Specific Fields ===
dilbegin get_email();
var
   pc : unitptr;
   email_expd : extraptr;
   email_str : string;
code
{
   pc := activator;
   email_expd := "$email" in pc.info;
   if (email_expd != null)
   {
      email_str := email_expd.descr;
      act("Email: " + email_str, A_ALWAYS, pc, null, null, TO_CHAR);
   }
   else
   {
      act("No email address set.", A_ALWAYS, pc, null, null, TO_CHAR);
   }
} dilend

=== Adding/Modifying Info Fields ===
dilbegin set_email();
var
   pc : unitptr;
   new_email : string;
code
{
   pc := activator;
   new_email := argument;
   
   // Remove existing email entry
   subextra(pc.info, "$email");
   
   // Add new email entry
   addextra(pc.info, {"$email"}, new_email);
   
   act("Email address updated.", A_ALWAYS, pc, null, null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

== Usage Notes ==

* The info field can only be accessed on player characters (PCs)
* Common fields include '''$email''' and '''$maiden'''
* Custom field names should be prefixed with a special character (like $) to avoid conflicts
* The structure is persistent and saved with the player data
* Use the '''in''' operator to search for specific fields in the info structure

== Error Handling ==

* Attempting to access info on NPCs or other unit types will result in failure
* Always check if the returned extraptr is null before accessing its fields
* Ensure proper error handling when working with player data
