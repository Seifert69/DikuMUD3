= SFB_DONE =

 constant: '''SFB_DONE'''

Message flag that activates DIL programs when commands are successfully completed.

== Description ==
The '''SFB_DONE''' constant is a message flag used with '''wait()''' and '''interrupt()''' functions to trigger DIL program activation when a command is successfully executed and completed. This allows DIL programs to be notified when other DIL programs finish executing commands that were being waited on.

When a DIL program is activated by SFB_DONE, the following global variables become available:
* '''activator''' - unit pointer to the character who executed the completed command
* '''medium''' - unit pointer to the unit that was operated upon during the command
* '''target''' - unit pointer to the target of the operation

The SFB_DONE message is sent after a command has been successfully processed, allowing other waiting DIL programs to resume execution or perform cleanup tasks.

== Examples ==
=== Basic Command Completion ===
 dilbegin command_notifier();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE, TRUE);
    
    exec("say A command was completed!", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Item Transfer Detection ===
 dilbegin item_transfer_watcher();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE, (command("give") or command("get")) and (self == activator));
    
    exec("say Item transfer completed.", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Multi-Program Coordination ===
 dilbegin coordinator();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE, TRUE);
    
    // Notify another program that operation is done
    sendtext("Operation completed, you may proceed.<br/>", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Service Completion Handler ===
 dilbegin service_handler();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE, command("buy") or command("sell"));
    
    if (command("buy"))
    {
       exec("say Purchase completed.", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Sale completed.", self);
    }
    
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Conditional Completion Detection ===
 dilbegin conditional_completion();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE, (command("repair") and (medium == activator)));
    
    exec("say Item repair completed.", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Combined Event Handling ===
 dilbegin multi_event_handler();
 var
 code
 {
    :start:
    wait(SFB_DONE | SFB_CMD, TRUE);
    
    if (command("give") or command("get"))
    {
       exec("say Item operation completed.", self);
    }
    else if (activator.type == UNIT_ST_PC)
    {
       exec("say Player completed an action.", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Some event occurred.", self);
    }
    
    goto start;
 } dilend

=== Interrupt-Based Completion ===
 dilbegin completion_interrupt();
 var
    interrupt_idx : integer;
 code
 {
    :start:
    interrupt_idx := interrupt(SFB_DONE, (command("craft") and (self == medium)), crafting_complete);
    
    wait(SFB_TICK, TRUE);
    
    goto start;
    
    :crafting_complete:
    exec("say Crafting completed!", self);
    clear(interrupt_idx);
    goto start;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* SFB_DONE triggers after successful command completion, not command attempts
* The message is sent when the command has been fully processed and executed
* '''activator''' points to the character who executed the completed command
* '''medium''' points to the unit that was operated upon (target of the operation)
* '''target''' points to the target unit of the completed operation
* SFB_DONE can be combined with other SFB_* flags using bitwise OR operator
* Programs must be waiting with interrupt(SFB_DONE, ...) to receive these messages
* Commonly used for multi-program coordination and service completion notifications
* The flag allows for asynchronous program coordination and cleanup operations

== Error Handling ==
* Always validate that '''activator''' is not null before using it in completion logic
* Ensure proper cleanup of interrupts when they're no longer needed
* Be careful with infinite loops when waiting for completion events
* Remember that SFB_DONE only triggers on successful completion, not failed commands
* Test completion handlers thoroughly as they can affect game flow
* Use appropriate condition checks to filter which completions should trigger your program
* Ensure target programs are properly waiting for SFB_DONE messages
