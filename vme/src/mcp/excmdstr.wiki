= excmdstr =

excmdstr is a built-in DIL variable that returns the first word/command string entered by a player as a string value.

== Description ==

The excmdstr variable contains the "first string" which was entered by a player. This represents the actual command word that triggered the DIL program. The variable is automatically converted to lowercase by the interpreter.

When combined with the '''argument''' variable, you can reconstruct the complete command as entered by the player:

 excmdstr + " " + argument

== Return Value ==

Returns a string containing the command word. If no extended command is available, returns NULL.

== Usage Notes ==

* The command string is converted to lowercase automatically
* For case-sensitive command checking, use '''excmdstr_case''' instead
* Commonly used in command validation and processing
* Essential for determining which command triggered a DIL program

== Example ==

The following example shows excmdstr being used to validate a quit command:

 dilbegin aware do_quit(arg : string);
 external
    on_connect@basis();

 var
    quit_str:string;

 code
 {
    if (quit_str=="logging on")
       quit;

    // Check if the actual command was "quit"
    if (excmdstr != "quit")
    {
       // Check if it starts with 'q' but isn't exactly "quit"
       if (excmdstr.[0] != "q")
          quit;

       sendtext ("You can't just type ["+excmdstr+"] you must type 'quit' no less to quit!<br/>",self);
       quit;
    }

    // Continue with quit processing...
 } dilend
