= objs =
 field: unitptr '''.objs''' (Read-only)

The '''objs''' field returns a pointer to the first object in a zone's object list.

== Description ==
The '''objs''' field provides access to the head of the linked list containing all objects defined within a specific zone. Based on the C implementation, this field operates on a zone pointer and calls the `findFirstObj()` method to retrieve the first object in that zone's object list.

== Field Access ==
This is a field access on zoneptrs:
 zone.objs

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* zoneptr

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is currently marked as obsolete and not used in any DIL programs
* The returned pointer can be used to traverse the zone's object list using the [[next]] field
* Use with [[findzone]] to get a zone pointer by name
* Combine with [[objcount]] to get the total number of objects in the zone

== Examples ==
 dilbegin list_zone_objects(zone_name : string);
 var
    target_zone : zoneptr;
    current_obj : unitptr;
    count : integer;
 
 code
 {
    target_zone := findzone(zone_name);
    
    if (target_zone == null)
    {
       act("Zone '$1t' not found.", A_ALWAYS, self, zone_name, null, TO_CHAR);
       return;
    }
    
    count := 0;
    current_obj := target_zone.objs;
    
    act("Objects in zone '$1t':", A_ALWAYS, self, zone_name, null, TO_CHAR);
    
    while (current_obj != null)
    {
       act("  $1n", A_ALWAYS, self, current_obj, null, TO_CHAR);
       count := count + 1;
       current_obj := current_obj.next;
    }
    
    act("Total: $1d objects", A_ALWAYS, self, count, null, TO_CHAR);
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
Always check the zone pointer for null and verify the return value:

 zone := findzone(zone_name);
 if (zone != null)
 {
    first_obj := zone.objs;
    if (first_obj != null)
    {
       // Safe to use the object pointer
       name := first_obj.name;
    }
    else
    {
       act("No objects in zone.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 }
 else
 {
    act("Zone not found.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }
