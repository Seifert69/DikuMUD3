= light =

; light : integer (RO)
: The number of active light sources in the unit.

== Description ==

The '''light''' field is a read-only property that returns the number of active light sources contained within a unit. This field is accessed using the dot notation on a unit pointer.

== Return Value ==

Returns an integer representing the count of active light sources in the specified unit.

== Example Usage ==

 dilbegin example_light();
 var
    light_count : integer;
 
 code
 {
    light_count := self.light;
    exec("say This unit contains " + itoa(light_count) + " light sources.", self);
 } dilend

== Notes ==

* This field is read-only and cannot be modified directly
* Use the [[setbright]] procedure to change how much light a unit emits
* The '''islight''' function can be used to check if a unit is a light source
* Related fields include '''bright''' (how much the unit lights up) and '''illum''' (light from transparent containers)
