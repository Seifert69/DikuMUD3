= full =

== Syntax ==
 unitptr.full

== Field Type ==
 integer (Read-write)

== Description ==
The full field represents how hungry a player character (PC) is. This field tracks the character's hunger level and is used to determine when a character needs to eat.

This field is only available for player characters (UNIT_ST_PC).

== Range ==
The typical range for hunger values depends on the game's configuration, but generally:
* Higher values indicate more hunger
* Lower values indicate less hunger (more full)
* The exact scale and thresholds are game-specific

== Example ==
 dilbegin check_hunger();
 var
    hunger_level : integer;
    
 code
 {
    hunger_level := self.full;
    
    if (hunger_level > 20)
    {
        act("You are very hungry.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else if (hunger_level > 10)
    {
        act("You are hungry.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else if (hunger_level < 5)
    {
        act("You feel quite full.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else
    {
        act("You are not particularly hungry.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    return;
 } dilend

 dilbegin eat_food(food : unitptr);
 var
    hunger_reduction : integer;
    
 code
 {
    if (food.objecttype != ITEM_FOOD)
    {
        act("That's not food!", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
        return;
    }
    
    hunger_reduction := food.value[0]; // Food value
    self.full := self.full - hunger_reduction;
    
    if (self.full < 0)
        self.full := 0;
    
    act("You eat $2n and feel less hungry.", A_ALWAYS, self, food, null, TO_CHAR);
    act("$1n eats $2n.", A_ALWAYS, self, food, null, TO_REST);
    
    destroy(food);
    return;
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This field is read-write and can be modified by DIL code
* Only available for player characters (UNIT_ST_PC), not NPCs
* Often used in conjunction with thirst and drunk fields for character condition tracking
* The field is typically modified by eating food items or by natural hunger progression over time
* Setting the value too low may cause the character to be unable to eat more
* Setting the value too high may cause hunger-related messages or effects
