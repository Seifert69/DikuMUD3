= hp =

 field: integer '''hp''' (Read/Write)

== Description ==
The '''hp''' field represents the current hitpoints of a unit. This field is read-write (RW) and can be accessed on any unit type including characters, mobiles, and objects.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.hp || integer || The current hitpoints of the unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes

* For characters and mobiles, this represents their current health
* For objects, this represents the object's durability/condition
* Setting hp to low values can render objects 'broken'
* If a unit has -1 hitpoints, it is considered unbreakable
* The field is read-write (RW) and can be modified
* Should typically be used in conjunction with max_hp to ensure values stay within valid ranges

== Examples

=== Basic Health Check

 if (self.hp > 10)
 {
    act("You are in good health.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
 }

=== Healing Example

 dilbegin heal_target(target : unitptr);
 var
 code
 {
    if (target.hp < target.max_hp)
    {
       target.hp := target.hp + 6;
       if (target.hp > target.max_hp)
         target.hp := target.max_hp;
       act("You feel better!", A_ALWAYS, target, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 } dilend

=== Cloning Attributes

 dilbegin clone_attr(original : unitptr, tgt : unitptr);
 var
    i : integer;
 code
 {
    /* Copy abilities */
    while (i < ABIL_TREE_MAX)
    {
       tgt.abilities[i] := original.abilities[i];
       i := i + 1;
    }

    /* Copy current hitpoints */
    tgt.hp := original.hp;

    quit;
 } dilend

=== Damage Example

 pc.hp := pc.hp - 100;
