field: integer '''.roomcount''' (Read-only)

The '''roomcount''' field provides access to the number of rooms contained within a zone.

== Description ==
The '''roomcount''' field is accessed on a zoneptr and returns an integer value representing the total number of rooms defined within that zone. This field is read-only and provides a quick way to determine zone size without needing to manually traverse through all rooms. The count includes all rooms registered to the zone, regardless of their current state or accessibility.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| zone.roomcount || integer || Returns the number of rooms in the zone
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* zoneptr (Zone Pointer)

== Examples ==
dilbegin zone_statistics();
var
    current_zone : zoneptr;
    buffer : string;
code
{
    current_zone := zhead();
    buffer := "Zone Statistics:&n&n";
    
    while (current_zone != null)
    {
        buffer := buffer + "Zone: " + current_zone.name + "&n";
        buffer := buffer + "  Rooms: " + itoa(current_zone.roomcount) + "&n";
        buffer := buffer + "  Objects: " + itoa(current_zone.objcount) + "&n";
        buffer := buffer + "  NPCs: " + itoa(current_zone.npccount) + "&n";
        buffer := buffer + "  Reset time: " + itoa(current_zone.resettime) + " minutes&n";
        buffer := buffer + "&n";
        
        current_zone := current_zone.next;
    }
    
    pagestring(buffer, self);
    quit;
}

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''roomcount''' field returns the total number of rooms defined in the zone's data files
* This count is read-only and cannot be modified directly
* The field is commonly used for zone statistics, administrative commands, and zone validation
* For performance reasons, use this field instead of manually counting rooms with loops
* The count includes all room types (normal, death rooms, etc.) within the zone
* This field appears to be rarely used in modern DIL code but remains functional

== Error Handling ==
* Returns 0 if the zone contains no rooms
* Returns DILV_FAIL if the zoneptr is null
* Returns DILV_ERR if accessed on an inappropriate unit type
* Always check that the zoneptr is valid before accessing this field
