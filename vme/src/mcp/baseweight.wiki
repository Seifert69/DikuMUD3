= baseweight =

== Description ==
Returns the base weight of a unit. This represents the empty weight of the unit without any contents or additional weight.

== Syntax ==
 baseweight(unit)

== Parameters ==
; unit : unitptr
: The unit whose base weight is being retrieved

== Return Value ==
: integer
: The base weight of the unit in grams

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_weight();
 var
  base_wt : integer;
  current_wt : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  base_wt := baseweight(self);
  current_wt := weight(self);
  sendtext("Base weight: " + itoa(base_wt) + "g<br/>", self);
  sendtext("Current weight: " + itoa(current_wt) + "g<br/>", self);
 } dilend

 dilbegin decapitation_example();
 var
  corpse : unitptr;
  head : unitptr;
 code
 {
  :start:
  corpse := medium;
  if (corpse.type == UNIT_ST_OBJ)
  {
    head := load("head@death");
    set_weight_base(head, baseweight(corpse) / 70);
    if (head.baseweight > 100)
    {
      set_weight_base(head, 100);
    }
    if (head.baseweight < 1)
    {
      set_weight_base(head, 1);
    }
  }
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This is a read-only property that returns the empty weight of a unit
* Base weight is different from current weight (which includes contents)
* Used in calculations for item creation, weight limits, and encumbrance
* Base weight is typically used with set_weight_base() function
* Weight values are in grams
* Commonly used in corpse processing, item creation, and equipment systems
