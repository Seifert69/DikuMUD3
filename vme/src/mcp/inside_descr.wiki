= inside_descr =

; inside_descr : string (RW)
: The description of the unit from the 'inside'. This field contains the text that players see when they are inside a unit (such as a room, vehicle, or container) and look around.

== Description ==

The '''inside_descr''' field provides access to the description text that is displayed when a character is inside a unit and issues a look command. This is most commonly used for rooms, but can also apply to containers, vehicles, or any other unit that can contain other units.

This field is read-write (RW), meaning it can be both read and modified by DIL programs to dynamically change the appearance of locations from within.

== Usage ==

=== Reading Inside Description ===

 dilbegin check_room_description();
    var
       room : unitptr;
       desc : string;
    code
    {
       room := self.outside;  // Get the room containing this object
       desc := room.inside_descr;
       
       act("Room description: " + desc, A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    } dilend

=== Modifying Inside Description ===

 dilbegin modify_room();
    var
       room : unitptr;
       new_desc : string;
    code
    {
       room := self.outside;
       new_desc := "This is a newly modified room description.";
       
       room.inside_descr := new_desc;
       act("The room has been modified.", A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    } dilend

=== Practical Example - Graffiti System ===

This example from the prompt shows how inside_descr is used in a graffiti system:

 dilbegin do_graffiti();
    var
       room : unitptr;
       original_desc : string;
       new_desc : string;
    code
    {
       room := self.outside.outside;  // Get the room
       original_desc := room.inside_descr;
       
       // Add graffiti to the room description
       new_desc := original_desc + " <div class='red'>Red graffiti is painted here!</div>";
       room.inside_descr := new_desc;
       
       act("You add graffiti to the room.", A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    } dilend

=== Checking for Description Changes ===

 dilbegin monitor_room();
    var
       room : unitptr;
       start_desc : string;
    code
    {
       room := self.outside;
       start_desc := room.inside_descr;
       
       // Wait for something to happen
       wait(SFB_TICK, command("check"));
       
       if (start_desc != room.inside_descr)
       {
          act("The room description has changed!", A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
       }
    } dilend

== Common Use Cases ==

* '''Dynamic Room Descriptions''' - Changing room descriptions based on events, time, or player actions
* '''Graffiti Systems''' - Allowing players to add temporary or permanent markings to rooms
* '''Environmental Effects''' - Modifying descriptions to reflect weather, damage, or magical effects
* '''Story Progression''' - Updating locations as stories advance
* '''Player Customization''' - Allowing players to modify their personal spaces

== Return Value ==

Returns a string containing the current inside description of the unit.

== Assignment ==

The field can be assigned a new string value to change the inside description:
 unit.inside_descr := "New description text";

== Persistence ==

When a unit is saved to disk (using the store function), the inside_descr field is preserved and will be restored when the unit is loaded again.

== See Also ==

* [[outside_descr]] - The description of the unit from the outside
* [[unitptr]] - Information about unit pointers and their fields
* [[extra]] - Extra descriptions system for more complex description handling
* [[act]] - Function for sending messages to players

== Notes ==

* The field is read-write (RW)
* Changes to inside_descr are immediately visible to players in the unit
* The description is saved with the unit if the unit is persistent
* HTML formatting can be included in the description text
* This field is commonly used for rooms but applies to any container unit
