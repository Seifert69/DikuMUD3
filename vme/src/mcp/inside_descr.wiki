= inside_descr =
 field: string '''inside_descr''' (Read/Write)

The '''inside_descr''' field contains the text that players see when they are inside a unit and look around.

== Description ==

The '''inside_descr''' field provides access to the description text that is displayed when a character is inside a unit and issues a look command. This is most commonly used for rooms, but can also apply to containers, vehicles, or any other unit that can contain other units.

This field is read-write (RW), meaning it can be both read and modified by DIL programs to dynamically change the appearance of locations from within.

== Field Access ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.inside_descr || string || The description text seen from inside the unit
|}

== Availability ==

This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==

=== Reading Inside Description ===
dilbegin check_room_description();
var
   room : unitptr;
   desc : string;
code
{
   room := self.outside;  // Get the room containing this object
   desc := room.inside_descr;
   
   act("Room description: " + desc, A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

=== Modifying Inside Description ===
dilbegin modify_room();
var
   room : unitptr;
   new_desc : string;
code
{
   room := self.outside;
   new_desc := "This is a newly modified room description.";
   
   room.inside_descr := new_desc;
   act("The room has been modified.", A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

=== Graffiti System ===
dilbegin do_graffiti();
var
   room : unitptr;
   original_desc : string;
   new_desc : string;
code
{
   room := self.outside.outside;  // Get the room
   original_desc := room.inside_descr;
   
   // Add graffiti to the room description
   new_desc := original_desc + " <div class='red'>Red graffiti is painted here!</div>";
   room.inside_descr := new_desc;
   
   act("You add graffiti to the room.", A_ALWAYS, activator, null, null, TO_CHAR);
} dilend

== Usage Notes ==

* Changes to inside_descr are immediately visible to players in the unit
* The description is saved with the unit if the unit is persistent
* HTML formatting can be included in the description text
* This field is commonly used for rooms but applies to any container unit
* Useful for dynamic room descriptions, graffiti systems, environmental effects, and story progression

== Error Handling ==

* Ensure the unit exists before accessing the field
* Be cautious with HTML formatting to avoid breaking display
* Consider length limits for very long descriptions
