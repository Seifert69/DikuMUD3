== Description ==
The '''extra''' field provides access to a unit's extra description list. Extra descriptions are additional data structures that can contain names, values, and descriptive text attached to units. This field returns an extraptr that points to the linked list of extra descriptions.

== Availability ==
This field is available on all unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage ==
The extra field returns an extraptr that can be used to access and manipulate extra descriptions.

=== Syntax ===
  unit.extra

=== Return Value ===
Returns an extraptr pointing to the unit's extra description list.

== Extraptr Structure ==
The returned extraptr provides access to the following members:

{| class="wikitable"
! Member !! Type !! Description
|-
| next || extraptr || Points to the next extra description in the list
|-
| names || stringlist || Array of names for the extra description
|-
| vals || integerlist || Array of integer values for the extra description
|-
| descr || string || Descriptive text
|}

== Example ==
 dilbegin check_corpse_notification(corpse:unitptr);
 var
    ex_list : extraptr;
 code
 {
    heartbeat:=3;
    if (corpse.type != UNIT_ST_OBJ)
       return;

    ex_list := corpse.extra;
    
    // Check if owner was already notified
    if ("$owner notified" in ex_list)
       sendtext("Owner has already been notified about this corpse.<br/>", self);
    else
       sendtext("Owner has not been notified yet.<br/>", self);
    
    return;
 } dilend

== Common Operations ==
* Use the '''in''' operator to check if a name exists in the extra list
* Use [[addextra()]] to add new extra descriptions
* Use [[subextra()]] to remove extra descriptions
* Navigate through the list using the '''next''' member

== Usage Notes ==
* Extraptr variables are volatile and may be cleared when rendered unusable
* Cannot declare static extraptr structures in DIL programs
* Extra descriptions are commonly used for quests, special descriptions, and unit flags
