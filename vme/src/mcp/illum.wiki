= illum =

 field: integer '''illum''' (Read-only)

== Description ==
The '''illum''' field returns the amount of light that units inside a transparent unit create. This field is read-only (RO) and represents the combined light output from all light sources contained within a transparent container.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.illum || integer || Light created by units inside transparent unit
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Usage Notes

* This field is read-only (RO) and cannot be modified directly
* Only applies to transparent units that can contain other units
* Represents the cumulative light from all light sources inside the container
* Different from the '''bright''' field which is how much the unit itself lights up
* Different from the '''light''' field which is how much light is inside the unit

== Light Field Comparison

{| class="wikitable"
! Field !! Description !! Read/Write !! Purpose
|-
| '''light''' || How much light is inside the unit || RO || Internal light level
|-
| '''bright''' || How much the unit lights up surroundings || RO || External light output
|-
| '''illum''' || Light created by units inside transparent unit || RO || Contained light sources
|}

== Examples

=== Checking Container Illumination

 dilbegin check_lamp(lamp : unitptr);
 var
    container : unitptr;
 code
 {
    if (lamp.outside)
    {
       container := lamp.outside;
       if (container.illum > 0)
       {
          act("The container glows with light from within.", 
              A_ALWAYS, container, null, null, TO_ALL);
       }
    }
 } dilend

=== Light Level Analysis

 dilbegin analyze_light();
 var
    total_light : integer;
 code
 {
    total_light := self.light + self.illum;
    
    if (total_light > 10)
    {
       act("This area is very well lit.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else if (total_light > 0)
    {
       act("This area is dimly lit.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    else
    {
       act("This area is dark.", A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
 } dilend
