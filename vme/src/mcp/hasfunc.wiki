= hasfunc =

 field: integer '''hasfunc''' (Read-only)

== Description ==
Returns TRUE if the unit has special functions attached to it. This is a read-only field of a unitptr.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| unit.hasfunc || integer || 1 if unit has special functions, 0 otherwise
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_NPC (Non-Player Character)
* UNIT_ST_OBJ (Object)
* UNIT_ST_ROOM (Room)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_dil_presence(target : unitptr);
 var
     has_dil : integer;
 code
 {
     has_dil := target.hasfunc;
     
     if (has_dil == 1)
     {
         act("$1n has special functions attached.", 
             A_ALWAYS, target, null, null, TO_ROOM);
     }
     else
     {
         act("$1n has no special functions.", 
             A_ALWAYS, target, null, null, TO_ROOM);
     }
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is read-only (RO)
* Special functions refer to DIL programs or other function pointers attached to the unit
* This function is currently marked as obsolete and not used anywhere in the existing DIL codebase
* It was part of a set of functions considered obsolete until needed and tested
* Can be used to check if a unit has DIL programs attached before attempting to interact with them

== Error Handling ==
* Always check if the unit pointer is valid before accessing '''hasfunc'''
* The field will return 0 for null or invalid unit pointers
