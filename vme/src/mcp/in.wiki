= in =
 operator: '''in'''

The 'in' operator is a multipurpose search operator used to check for the existence of elements within various data structures in DIL.

== Description ==
The '''in''' operator provides a convenient way to search for elements within different data types. It can be used to check if a string exists within another string (substring search), if a name exists in an extra description list, if a quest exists in a player's quest list, or if an element exists in a stringlist. This operator returns a boolean value (true/false) indicating whether the search was successful.

The operator is particularly useful for filtering operations, conditional checks, and data validation without requiring explicit loops or complex search functions.

== Usage ==
The 'in' operator has different behaviors depending on the data types involved:

=== String Substring Search ===
; search_term : string
: Checks if search_term exists as a substring within another string

=== Extra Description Search ===
; name : string
: Checks if an extra description with the specified name exists in an extra description list (or for PC .quests or PC .info - any extraptr data structure)

=== Stringlist Search ===
; element : string
: Checks if an element exists in a stringlist

== Return Value ==
Returns integer:
* '''1''' (true) - The element was found
* '''0''' (false) - The element was not found

== Examples ==
=== String Substring Search ===
dilbegin search_text();
var
    text : string;
    search_term : string;
code
{
    text := "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    search_term := "fox";
    
    if (search_term in text)
        sendtext("Found '" + search_term + "' in the text.<br/>", self);
    else
        sendtext("Could not find '" + search_term + "' in the text.<br/>", self);
} dilend

=== Extra Description Search ===
dilbegin check_special_flags(target : unitptr);
var
    ex_list : extraptr;
code
{
    ex_list := target.extra;
    
    // Check for special flags
    if ("$magical" in ex_list) {
        act("$2n has magical properties.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
    
    if ("$cursed" in ex_list) {
        act("$2n appears to be cursed.", A_ALWAYS, self, target, null, TO_CHAR);
    }
} dilend

=== Quest Status Check ===
dilbegin check_quest_status();
code
{
    // Check if player has specific quests
    if (LIB_COMPLETE in self.quests) {
        sendtext("You have completed the library quest.<br/>", self);
    }
    
    if (not LIB_ONGOING in self.quests) {
        sendtext("You don't have any ongoing library quests.<br/>", self);
    }
} dilend

=== Stringlist Operations ===
dilbegin check_inventory_items();
var
    item_names : stringlist;
code
{
    item_names := {"sword", "shield", "potion", "key"};
    
    // Check for specific items
    if ("sword" in item_names) {
        sendtext("You have a sword in your inventory.<br/>", self);
    }
    
    if ("wand" in item_names) {
        sendtext("You don't have a wand in your inventory.<br/>", self);
    }
} dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The 'in' operator is case-sensitive for string searches
* For extra descriptions and quests, the search is performed on the names field
* The operator returns boolean values (1 for true, 0 for false)
* String searches look for exact substring matches
* The operator is more efficient than manual loop-based searches
* Can be used in conditional statements (if, while) for filtering logic
* Particularly useful in quest systems and inventory management

== Error Handling ==
* Using 'in' operator on null or undefined variables will result in runtime errors
* Ensure both operands are of compatible types before using the operator
* For string searches, very long search strings may impact performance
* Invalid data types will cause compilation errors
