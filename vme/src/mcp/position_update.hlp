 position_update ( u : unitptr )
    u : A pointer to a player or a monster. The character will be
        updated and perhaps killed, incapacitated, mortally
        wounded, revived, etc. depending on current hitpoints.
        Useful when tampering with the 'hp' field. Example:

        pc.hp := pc.hp - 100;
        position_update(pc);
