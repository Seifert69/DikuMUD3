= on...goto =
 statement: '''on''' n : integer goto (label1 : string, label2 : string, ...);

Conditional goto statement that transfers program control to different labels based on integer value.

== Description ==
The '''on''' statement with multiple labels provides a structured way to transfer program control to different sections based on the value of an integer expression. It's essentially a multi-way conditional jump that selects which label to jump to based on the integer parameter 'n'.

The construct takes the form:
 on n goto (label1, label2, ..., labelN);

Where 'n' is the integer value to evaluate, and the program jumps to the label corresponding to that value. If 'n' is 0, the program jumps to label1; if 'n' is 1, it jumps to label2; and so on. The number of labels must match the range of possible values for 'n'.

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| n || integer || The integer value to evaluate for label selection
| label1 || string || The label to jump to when n equals 0
| label2 || string || The label to jump to when n equals 1
| ... || string || Additional labels for subsequent values (label3 for n=2, etc.)
|}

== Examples ==
 dilbegin multi_direction();
 var
    direction : integer;
 code
 {
    :start:
    direction := rnd(0, 3);
    
    on direction goto (north, south, east, west);
    
    :north:
    exec("go north", self);
    goto start;
    
    :south:
    exec("go south", self);
    goto start;
    
    :east:
    exec("go east", self);
    goto start;
    
    :west:
    exec("go west", self);
    goto start;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''on''' statement with multiple labels is equivalent to a series of if-else statements
* The integer parameter 'n' determines which label to jump to (0-based indexing)
* Labels must be defined elsewhere in the program using the format ':labelname:'
* The number of labels provided must match the range of possible values for 'n'
* If 'n' is outside the range of provided labels, the on statement is skipped
* This construct is useful for creating state machines, menu systems, or multi-way branching
* The on statement provides cleaner code structure compared to nested if-else chains
* Each label represents a potential execution path from the current point

== Error Handling ==
* Ensure the integer 'n' is properly validated before using it in the on statement
* Verify that all referenced labels exist in the program
* Check that the range of 'n' values matches the number of labels provided
* Be careful with infinite loops when using on statements without proper exit conditions
* Remember that on statements transfer control unconditionally - they don't check conditions
* Test all possible code paths to ensure proper behavior for each value of 'n'
* Use meaningful label names to improve code readability and maintenance
