field: integer '''.weapon_levels'''[idx] (Read-only)

The .weapon_levels field provides access to the skill level of a specific weapon type for a player character.

== Description ==
The .weapon_levels field returns the current skill level that a player character has achieved with a specific weapon type. This represents the character's proficiency and training with that particular weapon category. The skill level affects combat accuracy, damage, and other weapon-related calculations.

| pc.weapon_levels[idx] || integer || Returns the skill level for weapon type 'idx'
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Parameters ==
The field requires an integer index parameter:
; idx : integer
: The weapon type index (WPN_* constants from values.h and/or vme.h)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_weapon_skill(pc : unitptr, weapon_type : integer);
 var
    level : integer;
 code
 {
    level := pc.weapon_levels[weapon_type];
    
    if (level > 0)
    {
       sendtext("You have skill level " + itoa(level) + " with this weapon type.&n", pc);
    }
    else
    {
       sendtext("You have not trained with this weapon type.&n", pc);
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

 dilbegin list_weapon_skills(pc : unitptr);
 var
    i : integer;
    level : integer;
 code
 {
    sendtext("Your weapon skills:&n", pc);
    
    for (i := 0; i < 10; i := i + 1)
    {
       level := pc.weapon_levels[i];
       if (level > 0)
       {
          sendtext("Weapon " + itoa(i) + ": level " + itoa(level) + "&n", pc);
       }
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The field is only accessible for player characters (UNIT_ST_PC)
* The weapon index must be within the valid range (0 to WPN_TREE_MAX - 1)
* Skill levels typically range from 0 (untrained) to higher values representing proficiency
* This field is read-only - skill levels are modified through training and practice
* The skill level directly impacts combat effectiveness with the weapon type
* When accessed from a zone with access level 0, returns a reference to the actual value
* When accessed from other zones, returns a copy of the value

== Error Handling ==
* If accessed on a non-PC unit, the operation will fail
* If the weapon index is out of range, the operation will fail
* Invalid parameter types will result in an error
