 field: integer '''.ability_levels'''[ability_index] (Read-only)

The '''ability_levels''' field is a read-only array field available on player character units that provides access to the training level requirements for abilities.

== Description ==
This field provides access to the training level requirements for abilities. The requirements are stored in an array indexed by ability constants.

== Field Access ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Access !! Type !! Description
|-
| player.ability_levels[ability_index] || integer || The training level requirement for specified ability
|}

== Availability ==
This field is available on the following unit types:
* UNIT_ST_PC (Player Character)

== Parameters ==
{| class="wikitable"
! Parameter !! Type !! Description
|-
| ability_index || integer || Ability index (ABIL_* constant)
|}

== Ability Constants ==
The ability_index parameter accepts any of the ABIL_* constants defined in values.h or vme.h:

{| class="wikitable"
! Constant !! Description
|-
| ABIL_STR || Strength training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_DEX || Dexterity training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_CON || Constitution training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_CHA || Charisma training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_BRA || Brains/Intelligence training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_MAG || Magic training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_DIV || Divine training level requirement
|-
| ABIL_HP || Hit Points training level requirement
|}

== Examples ==
=== Basic Level Check ===
 dilbegin check_ability_level(player : unitptr, ability : integer);
 code
 {
    if (player.type != UNIT_ST_PC) {
       send("This function only works on players.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (ability >= 0 and ability < ABIL_TREE_MAX) {
       send("Training level requirement: " + itoa(player.ability_levels[ability]));
    } else {
       send("Invalid ability index.");
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

=== Training Eligibility Check ===
 dilbegin can_train_ability(player : unitptr, ability : integer);
 var
    required_level : integer;
    current_level : integer;
 code
 {
    if (player.type != UNIT_ST_PC) {
       send("This function only works on players.");
       quit;
    }
    
    if (ability < 0 or ability >= ABIL_TREE_MAX) {
       send("Invalid ability index.");
       quit;
    }
    
    required_level := player.ability_levels[ability];
    current_level := player.level;
    
    if (current_level >= required_level) {
       send("You meet the level requirement for this training.");
    } else {
       send("You need to be level " + itoa(required_level) + " to train this ability.");
       send("Current level: " + itoa(current_level));
    }
    quit;
 } dilend

== Error Handling ==
The field performs comprehensive validation:
* '''Player validation'' - Ensures unit is a valid PC (not NPC)
* '''Index validation'' - Checks that ability index is between 0 and ABIL_TREE_MAX - 1
* '''Type validation'' - Returns fail if accessed on non-PC units

Note: The C implementation shows that this field:
* Only works on player characters (PCs), not NPCs
* Uses getAbilityLevelAtIndex() function to retrieve level requirements
* Has commented-out code that suggests it was originally designed to return references for certain access levels
* Uses is_in() to validate ability index range
* Different behavior based on zone access level (reference vs integer return)

== Usage Notes ==
* This field is read-only for reading ability training level requirements
* Only available on player character units (UNIT_ST_PC type)
* Level requirements are typically used to determine when players can train certain abilities
* The field is commonly used in training systems, guild masters, and eligibility validation
* Ability level requirements work in conjunction with character's current level for training validation
* Ability constants are defined in values.h and vme.h header files
* This field appears to be obsolete or rarely used based on code comments
* Often used together with ability_costs field for complete training validation
