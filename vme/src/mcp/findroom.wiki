= findroom =

== Syntax ==
 unitptr findroom( s : string )

== Parameters ==
; s : string
: Symbolic name of room in the format "room_name@zone_name"

== Return Value ==
Returns a pointer to the room, or null if the room is not found or if the symbolic name is not a room.

== Description ==
This function finds and returns a room unitptr based on its symbolic name. The symbolic name should be in the format "room_name@zone_name".

If the symbolic name exists but is not a room (e.g., it's an object, NPC, or player), the function will return null.

== Notes ==
This function is primarily provided for historical reasons. Using findsymbolic() is equally efficient and provides the same functionality, but can return any type of unit, not just rooms.

== Example ==
 room := findroom("inn@udgaard");

This example finds the room with the symbolic name "inn@udgaard" and assigns it to the variable room.
