= attack_type =

== Description ==
Returns or sets the non-weapon attack type of a character unit. This property determines what type of unarmed combat the character uses.

== Syntax ==
 attack_type(unit)

== Parameters ==
; unit : unitptr
: The character unit whose attack type is being accessed or modified

== Return Value ==
: integer
: The current attack type of the character

== Examples ==
 dilbegin check_attack_type();
 var
  current_attack : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  current_attack := attack_type(self);
  sendtext("Your current attack type is " + weapon_name(current_attack) + ".<br/>", self);
 } dilend

 dilbegin set_attack_type(new_type : string);
 var
  attack_list : stringlist;
  type_list : intlist;
  i : integer;
  found : integer;
 code
 {
  :start:
  attack_list := {"fist", "kick", "knee", "elbow"};
  type_list := {WPN_FIST, WPN_KICK, WPN_KNEE, WPN_ELBOW};  
  i := 0;
  found := FALSE;
  while (i < length(attack_list))
  {
    if (left(attack_list.[i], length(new_type)) == new_type)
    {
      found := TRUE;
      break;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  if (found == TRUE)
  {
    self.attack_type := type_list.[i];
    sendtext("Attack type set to " + attack_list.[i] + ".<br/>", self);
  }
  else
  {
    sendtext("Invalid attack type. Available: fist, kick, knee, elbow.<br/>", self);
  }
 } dilend

== Notes ==
* This is a read-write property that can be modified
* Attack types correspond to weapon type constants (WPN_FIST, WPN_KICK, etc.)
* Only applies to character units (PCs and NPCs)
* Used for unarmed combat when no weapon is equipped
* The attack_type affects combat animations and damage calculations
* Common attack types include: fist, kick, knee, elbow
