= heartbeat =

 variable: '''heartbeat'''

== Description ==
Controls the heartbeat rate of a DIL program. This determines how frequently the SFB_TICK (tick) event is activated for the program.

== Usage Notes ==
The heartbeat can be assigned at runtime to change the rate with which SFB_TICK is activated. The value is specified in 1/4th of a second units.

 heartbeat := PULSE_SEC * 25; // Tick every 25 seconds

Use the PULSE_SEC constant to multiply your wanted delay:
* PULSE_SEC = 4 (represents 1 second)
* PULSE_SEC * 5 = 20 (represents 5 seconds)
* PULSE_SEC * 60 = 240 (represents 1 minute)

== Examples ==
 dilbegin simple_timer();
 var
     counter : integer;
 code
 {
     counter := 0;
     heartbeat := PULSE_SEC * 10; // Tick every 10 seconds
     
:start:
     wait(SFB_TICK, TRUE);
     counter := counter + 1;
     act("Timer tick #" + itoa(counter), A_ALWAYS, self, null, null, TO_CHAR);
     
     if (counter < 5)
         goto start;
     else
         exec("say Timer finished!", self);
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* Do not set the heartbeat too low as it can impact server performance
* The heartbeat value is in 1/4 second increments (4 = 1 second)
* Use PULSE_SEC constant for readability and proper timing
* Common values:
** PULSE_SEC * 1 = 4 (1 second)
** PULSE_SEC * 5 = 20 (5 seconds)
** PULSE_SEC * 60 = 240 (1 minute)
** WAIT_SEC * 5 = commonly used for 5-second intervals

== Error Handling ==
* Setting heartbeat to 0 or negative values may cause unexpected behavior
* Very low heartbeat values (less than PULSE_SEC) can impact server performance
