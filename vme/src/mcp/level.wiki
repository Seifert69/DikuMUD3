'''level''' is a field that returns level information for characters and commands.

== Syntax ==
 // For character units (PC/NPC)
 integer unit.level

 // For command pointers  
 integer cmdptr.level

== Return Value ==
; integer
: Returns the level value:
* For PC/NPC units: the character's level
* For command pointers: minimum level required to use the command
Returns '''fail''' if the unit is not a character or command pointer.

== Character Usage ==
When accessed on a player character (PC) or non-player character (NPC), returns the character's current level:

 // Check player level
 if (activator.level > 20) {
    exec("say You are experienced enough to enter.", self);
 }

 // Level-based restrictions
 if (pc.level < 253) {
    sendtext("You must be at least level 253 to use this command.", pc);
    quit;
 }

 // Compare levels between characters
 if (self.level < target.level) {
    exec("say $2n is too powerful for me to fight.", self, target);
 }

== Command Usage ==
When accessed on a command pointer, returns the minimum level required to use that command:

 // Get command and check level requirement
 cmd := getcommand("kick");
 if (self.level < cmd.level) {
    sendtext("You must be level " + itoa(cmd.level) + " to use kick.", self);
 }

 // List all commands with their level requirements
 cmd := chead();
 while (cmd) {
    sendtext(cmd.name + " (requires level " + itoa(cmd.level) + ")", self);
    cmd := cmd.next;
 }

== Access Control ==
The level field is commonly used for access control and content gating:

 // Immortal level checks (typically 200+)
 if (self.level >= IMMORTAL_LEVEL) {
    // Allow immortal-only actions
    exec("wizi", self);
 }

 // Level-based area restrictions
 if (activator.level < 10) {
    act("$1n says 'This area is too dangerous for beginners.'", 
        A_ALWAYS, self, null, activator, TO_VICT);
 }

== Notes ==
* For characters, this field is read-only
* The level system typically ranges from 1 to 253 for players, with 200+ being immortal levels
* NPCs also have levels that determine their difficulty
* Command level requirements prevent low-level characters from using powerful commands
* The field returns fail if accessed on invalid unit types
