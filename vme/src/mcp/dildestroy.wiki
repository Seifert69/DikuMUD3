= dildestroy =

'''dildestroy''' is a DIL function that removes DIL programs from units based on template name.

== Syntax ==
 integer := dildestroy( s : string, u : unitptr );

== Parameters ==
; s
: Name of DIL template to delete from unit
; u
: Unit to remove DIL program from

== Return Value ==
Returns an integer:
* Number of programs destroyed (typically 1 if found, 0 if not found)
* Error value if parameters were invalid

== Description ==
The dildestroy function searches for and removes DIL programs attached to a specified unit that match the given template name. This allows for precise removal of specific DIL instances without affecting other programs running on the same unit.

The function:
* Searches all DIL programs attached to the target unit
* Matches programs by template name (exact string match)
* Removes all matching programs from the unit
* Returns count of programs successfully destroyed

== Usage Notes ==
* Only removes programs matching the exact template name specified
* Multiple instances of the same template can be destroyed with one call
* The function is commonly used for:
** Cleaning up temporary effect programs
** Removing quest triggers when completed
** Stopping recurring behaviors
** Managing state-based DIL attachments

== Example ==
 dilbegin item_charge(base_charge:integer);
 external
   string accept_dil@function (pc:unitptr,s:string);

 var
    thing   : unitptr;
    pc      : unitptr;
    answer  : string;

 code
 {
 :start:
    wait (SFB_DONE,( (command("give")) and (self==target) ));

    pc:=activator;
    thing:=medium;
    secure(pc,lost_pc);
    secure(thing,lost_pc);

    dilcopy ("busy@function(Please wait I am busy with other work right now.", self);

    // ... processing logic ...

 :give_back:
    act( self.name + " returns your " + thing.name + " to you.",
        A_ALWAYS,pc,null,null,TO_CHAR);
    act(self.name + " returns $1n's " + thing.name + " to $1m.",
        A_SOMEONE,pc,null,null,TO_REST);
    link(thing,pc);

 :lost_pc:
    // Remove the busy message DIL program
    die := dildestroy ("busy@function",self);
    unsecure(pc);
    unsecure(thing);
    goto start;
 } dilend
