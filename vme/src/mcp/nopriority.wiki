= nopriority =

== Syntax ==
 function: '''nopriority'''();

== Description ==
The '''nopriority''' function cancels any active priority procedures for the current DIL program. This function is used to reset the priority system, allowing other DIL programs to handle activation interrupts without being blocked by higher-priority routines that were previously set.

== Return Value ==
Returns '''integer''':
* '''0''' - Successfully canceled priority procedures
* '''non-zero''' - Error code if cancellation failed

== Examples ==
 dilbegin reset_priority_system();
 var
    result : integer;
 code
 {
    // Set up a high priority routine
    priority(SFB_MSG, argument == "admin_reset");
    
    // Later, cancel it to allow normal operation
    result := nopriority();
    
    if (result == 0)
    {
       exec("say Priority system reset successfully.", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Failed to reset priority system.", self);
    }
 } dilend

 dilbegin temporary_override();
 var
    old_priority : integer;
 code
 {
    // Set a temporary high priority for emergency handling
    priority(SFB_MSG, argument == "emergency_stop");
    
    // Do some emergency processing
    exec("say Emergency protocol activated!", self);
    pause;
    
    // Cancel the emergency priority to restore normal operation
    old_priority := nopriority();
    
    if (old_priority == 0)
    {
       exec("say Emergency protocol deactivated.", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Failed to deactivate emergency.", self);
    }
 } dilend

 dilbegin priority_manager();
 var
    current_priority : integer;
 code
 {
    :check_priority:
    pause;
    
    // Check current priority state (this would be set by other systems)
    current_priority := interrupt(SFB_PRIORITY, argument == "get_status");
    
    if (current_priority == -1)
    {
       exec("say No priority procedures are currently active.", self);
    }
    else
    {
       exec("say Priority procedures are active with level: " + itoa(current_priority), self);
    }
    
    goto check_priority;
 } dilend

== Usage Notes ==
* The '''nopriority''' function cancels all priority procedures set by [[priority]] function
* Used to reset interrupt handling to default state
* Common in systems that need to temporarily override priority behavior:
** Emergency stop routines
** Administrative override functions
** System reset procedures
* Priority levels determine which DIL program gets control during activation
* Higher priority numbers take precedence over lower ones

== Error Handling ==
* Returns '''0''' on successful cancellation
* Returns '''non-zero''' error code if cancellation fails
* The function itself does not validate parameters - errors come from the underlying priority system
