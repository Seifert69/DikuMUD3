notes
"This is the guild of the bounty hunters. In version 1.0 we introduce some 
early implementations of gamification features taken from modern gaming. 
There is significant opportunity in the future to expand on this. 

Expanding rewards, new types of bounties, bonuses, loot boxes (game money 
not IRL money), adding a cost to bounties, teaching
skills / spells to aid in bounty hunting, etc are all on the table.

Leaderboards are also a significant part of the process, that is not yet 
implemented as of v1.0. There is some code in the zone to implement that, but
it seemed a messy and cumbersome implementation. I'll look to leverage existing 
competition zone infrastructure for future versions.

///////////////////////////////
get 30 daily bounty streak
talk to bounty hunter, accept question
pray to enter sanctum, feast
talk to the guide. Get ability to feast.
talk to the historian. 
talk to the blacksmith. 
	do quest.
	   500,000 lbs of steel. ** Need to write ability to count, accept, and track.
	   200,000 lbs of coal. ** See the Summoner. Add area to sanctum. Create summoner and task, etc.
	Forge unbreakable armor/weapon?
	Get ability to list arms/armors.
	
talk to the jeweler.

	Get ability to buy jewely.
talk to summoner
	do quest
	get ability to buy mag stuff
talk to necromancer
	do quest
	get ability to buy div stuff
talk to the historian. 

	
Jewelry, as well as arms/armor use birthstones and... perhaps some other material?
for crafting. Crafting these items allows creation of a wide range of items, with each
birthstone representing a unique ability or other boost.

killing sprees are run by the Blacksmith, as a means to winnow down the hordes 
of evil facing the eventual hero.

Special thanks to Jager, for unwittingly sharing his package delivery scheme.
It's a perfect fit for newbies to enjoy bounties! Thanks brother. :)

Special thanks to Papi for creating the login streak bounties. It was a great idea!

Final reward will be a hero plate (like friend plate) with a mana palm orb
as well. Tag for players will be * Hero *

"The Guild of the Bounty Hunters is an ancient institution that has survived 
and indeed thrived on the outskirts of Midgaard. Wealthy patrons who need 
something handled, a back-door to men of law finding their mark, and any 
number of other needs have been brought before the bounty hunters."

/* Bounty System!

There are a few helper functions here to assist with the bounty system.

integer add_bp@bounty(n : integer, u : unitptr);

n - the number of bounty points to add or subtract.
u - the unitptr to the unit which you want to interact.

Function is useful to safely adding or subtracting bounty points.
Will return the number of bounty points AFTER the transaction has processed.
If the value is less than 0, bounty points will be set to 0, 
and that is waht will return.

To use this as a check in the case of a situation where you dont want to allow
it to go below 0, such as in a store to use the bp in a transaction, simply 
pass 0 as the n value, and it will return the current number of bounty points.
